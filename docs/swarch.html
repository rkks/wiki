<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Basic function of an architecture needs to be well understand and well stated.</p></li>
<li><p>Time To Market (TTM) is critical for any business to operate and get an edge over competition.</p></li>
<li><p>The simplest design that meets the requirements is the best and most desirable design. Simple means, nothing more (over-engineer), nothing less (under-engineer).</p></li>
<li><p>The architectural limit of any hardware is generally the maximum load that the said hardware could carry in a stable fashion given a “perfect” implementation of the software. The design goal for all softwares is to reach this architectural limit. However, perfection in every possible dimension is not a goal because it is by definition unattainable.</p></li>
<li><p>Decreased inter-card, inter-node, inter-process communication to improve the performance. This can be realized by minimum inter-dependency. But this does not dismiss the modularity as a goal. Rather that the performance takes a precedence whenever benefits of modularity are not clearly and greatly exceeding the promise of a better performance. At the end of the day, customer pays for the performance.</p></li>
<li><p>Fewer number of processes and threads, but large enough to cater to all the processing needs. Each process to have single, well defined responsibility. All the waiting/blocking calls summed up into a single thread. Minimum code on critical path.</p></li>
<li><p>No duplication of state/data, except for redundancy. However, in the choice of memory versus processing speed in fastpath, processing speed takes preference.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid dynamic memory allocation at run-time. Take statistical feedback’s and feedback’s from user to tune the memory configurations. User feedback takes precedence.</p></li>
<li><p>Architecture needs to support variety of hardware and operating systems. Abstractions and plug-gable software architecture can be used to achieve this. Portability is to be provided without sacrificing on the performance.</p></li>
<li><p>High availability is not a mandate, but a feature that can be turned off and on. HA should not cost performance. System needs to be highly available, at NIC, node, and system levels. Flexibility in design is required to provide limiting impact on network planning, however performance impact takes precedence.</p></li>
<li><p>Designs should be made extensible to accommodate the easy addition of the new features. Create extensible API’s using flags to be passed to each API. This will minimize the need for api_func(), api_func2(), api_fun3(), etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Data structures design defines the limit of software performance. Couple the information that are naturally accessed together, seperate those that aren’t dependent.</p></li>
<li><p>Have minimum locks. Allow atomic locks on smallest region, big enough to protect data. Nested locks are evil, when used in out-of-order can cause deadlocks. Use spin-locks on when required.</p></li>
<li><p>A good and complete state machine provides the best (and earliest) insight into component and system behavior and performance.</p></li>
<li><p>A good machine provides best responsiveness to its user. Minimum startup time, maximum responsiveness are keys to easy system adoption by users.</p></li>
<li><p>Dynamic restart-ability of the process becomes a big plus in providing software watchdog and self-healing capabilities to the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Visibility into the system at run-time is the most desired at deployments. Visibility at runtime configuration, cpu utilization, core allocation, memory usage, memory consumption statistics, network usage statistics, memory allocation error statistics, network error statistics, overall system state, centralized logs, debug logs, and ability to logon into and inspect any hardware is key to diagnostics.</p></li>
<li><p>Debugg-ability of the system defines its robustness. Debugger availability, coverage tools, core file generation facility, memory profiling tools, call flow analysis tools, in-circuit tests, register dumping tools, register configuration tools, hardware access tools, diagnostic self-tests are required to ease the mass production of the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Keeping the system cost to minimum without sacrificing on the performance and quality is the goal of every product development. A system is both hardware and supporting software. So, due considerations must be given to identify the hardware components that are not required, the optimizations in hardware + software that can together reduce the need for extra hardware components, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Performance Per Watt is the industry standard to measure performance. So, the electrical qualities of the system should meet the EC, WEEE and other standards.</p></li>
<li><p>The network connects for data traffic, management traffic, and replication traffic must be independent of each other so that they do not affect the performance of each other.</p></li>
<li><p>Some components like Fabric Interface Cards, TCAM cards, etc. can be made as add-on cards so that in future the component could be upgraded easily to latest technology.</p></li>
