060101%Bash Tips & Tricks%bash.html%January 1, 2006%Sun, 01 Jan 2006 IST%<p>I have lost countless hours tracking different issues in my bash settings. Either vim doesn’t work OR screen doesn’t work OR some other platform has an issue. Being an enthusiast to I keep on updating my configurations regularly with some good stuff. But, each time that I make a change, I do not try to test it in every way, as in restarting every application that is dependent on these configuration file and ensuring that everything works fine. Simply because there are way too many applications that depend on environment settings and it is impossible to test every god-damn application.</p>

060101%Amazing Tips & Tricks%tipsntricks.html%January 1, 2006%Sun, 01 Jan 2006 IST%<p>Set your camera’s self timer to 10 seconds, then lineup your shot. The goal is to get you thinking about composition, but only so much that you have a deadline and still have to actually take a photograph. The self-imposed ten second countdown forces you to set up your photo quickly, but you’ll probably still have a second or two near the end you can use to think again, see if there are any changes you could make, and make them before the timer goes off. Same can be applied for any work. Identify a reasonable time for any task and put a timer. Challenge yourself to complete a task within anticipated timeframe.</p>

060101%Working on Large Codebase%largecode.html%January 1, 2006%Sun, 01 Jan 2006 IST%<p>Step through code in debug mode to see how it works Pair up with someone more familiar with the code base than you, taking turns to be the person coding and the person watching/discussing. Rotate partners amongst team members so knowledge gets spread around. Write unit tests. Start with an assertion of how you think code will work. If it turns out as you expected, you’ve probably understood the code. If not, you’ve got a puzzle to solve and or an enquiry to make. (Thanks Donal, this is a great answer) Go through existing unit tests for functional code, in a similar fashion to above Read UML, Doxygen generated class diagrams and other documentation to get a broad feel of the code. Make small edits or bug fixes, then gradually build up Keep notes, and don’t jump in and start developing; it’s more valuable to spend time understanding than to generate messy or inappropriate code.</p>

The company underwent an acquisition during last year by a competitor. As opposed to the acquirer killing the acquired firm, it was a kind of reverse acquisition - where people from the acquired company took over the key positions of the acquirer firm. That is, our CEO became CEO of acquirer company. And he placed his trusted people from his previous company into the key positions of acquirer firm.</p>

060101%Solve impossible problems%problemsolveimp.html%January 1, 2006%Sun, 01 Jan 2006 IST%<p>Often problems appear intractable, difficult, and some times impossible to solve. MacCready says: “If the problem you are trying to solve involves creating a magnum opus, you are solving the wrong problem”. That is, if the problem that you are trying to solve requires a lot of effort and time to create the problem itself in first place and/or to attempt a first hand solution, then you are solving a wrong problem.</p>
060101%How do you approach a new problem?%problemsolvenew.html%January 1, 2006%Sun, 01 Jan 2006 IST%<p>By its very nature, problem determination is about dealing with the unknown and the unexpected. If you knew in advance everything about all the problems that you could encounter and exactly how they manifest themselves, then you would take measures to prevent them and wouldn’t have to investigate them. You cannot expect that problem determination should be a perfectly predictable process, but there are a number of common approaches that can make the process go smoother and be more effective.</p>
