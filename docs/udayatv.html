<p>I am a regular viewer of Udaya TV channel. I would like to raise my concerns and complain against a show run between 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM called “Om”.</p>
<p>Program is misleading and language used in the program can have severe consequences. As an example, I would like to emphasize on one particular instance happened at around 8:40 AM on 20/Sept/2012. The lady postured as astrologist was questioned on pregnancy of his daughter by a father of a married woman. For the question, the astrologist responded with an opinion that her husband has a fault due to which couple are deprived of child. Such an accuse can cause problem to family life of the caller and can cause irreparable damage to married life of the couple under consideration.</p>
<p>Many similar incidents have happened in past, where astrologer has provided misleading information to innocent public. Such an act of vandalism by astrologer deserves to be criticized and should be stopped at all costs to maintain cultural peace and welfare in society. I expect that you would consider my concerns with importance and act on it.</p>
<p>If no actions are taken in this regard within a week, I would be forced to approach honorable court and broadcasting authorities of India to take corrective actions against channel. Expecting an early response from the channel in this regard.</p>
<p>Ravi</p>
<h1 id="udaya-tvs-response-to-the-email">Udaya TV’s response to the email</h1>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>In reply to your mail we have clarified the same with the Astrologer and based on the clarifications received we are stating as follows.</p>
<p>Whenever a viewer calls us during the programme with his/her query the caller expects the Astrologer to provide him/her with a solution to their problem. With regard to issue raised by you it is clarified that during the conversation the Astrologer had expressed that she will be more comfortable speaking to the daughter or your son-in-law and not to girl’s father , but when the caller insisted the Astrologer had specifically called upon to pass on the information given by her to his daughter and son-in-law.</p>
<p>It is further elaborated that the programme deals with Astrology which depends on planetary movements. So when the Astrologer said that when the caller’s son-in-law is having some dosha she meant the dosha was with regard to certain planetary positioning of the caller’s son-in-law and not on the physical front. Moreover the said programme is a astrological programme handled by an astrologer and not by a doctor to speak about the physical factors which are preventing his son-in-law from having a child.</p>
<p>It is further enumerated that we have always tried our level best to be very accurate when providing information to our viewers and we will continue to do so in the future too. Further we have been receiving several of letters on a daily basis wherein our viewers have written as to how they are benefitted after getting answers to their queries by the Astrologer. We are really very thankful to you for being a regular viewer of our channel and for the feedbacks which will help us to have better insights.</p>
<h1 id="update">Update</h1>
<p>In response to my email, Udaya TV has stopped broadcast of the said programme.</p>
