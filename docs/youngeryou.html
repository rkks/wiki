<p>Supplementing with additional zinc can create good health all over. The latest research shows that zinc can protect us against specific immune diseases, such as esophageal cancer. I consider the essential nutrient zinc to be a super aging code buster because it is able to achieve all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Maintains a healthy immune system</p></li>
<li><p>Accelerates wound healing</p></li>
<li><p>Maintains sense of taste and smell</p></li>
<li><p>Maintains sight</p></li>
<li><p>Helps synthesize DNA</p></li>
<li><p>Supports normal growth and development</p></li>
<li><p>Helps sperm develop</p></li>
<li><p>Promotes ovulation and fertilization</p></li>
<li><p>Protects against prostate problems</p></li>
<li><p>Helps protect against cancer</p></li>
<li><p>Helps decrease cholesterol deposits</p></li>
<li><p>Is good for hair and skin health</p></li>
<li><p>Helps preserve mental faculties in the elderly</p></li>
<li><p>Detoxifies and removes lead, cadmium, aluminum, and other toxins</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Fish oils are another super nutrient pause buster. Unlike zinc, fish oils are obviously not something the body naturally produces. Instead, beneficial fish oils come from cold-water fish, such as mackerel, salmon, black cod, albacore tuna, sardines, and herring. The active ingredients in fish oils are essential fatty acids known as omega-3 fatty acids. Fish oils benefit both adults and children, and it’s never too late to begin supplementing these additional nutrients.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-rainbow-plate">Creating a Rainbow Plate</h2>
<p>Each of your three meals, plus one snack, should be at least 80 percent plant based and no more than 20 percent animal based. Your plate should always look like a rainbow: not too much of any one color and always a variety. All of your food choices and supplements should be from natural food sources and organic when possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Instead of white rice, choose brown rice.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of white sugar, try brown sugar or honey.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of white potatoes, eat sweet potatoes and yams.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of white flour, use whole-grain flour.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of salt, season your meals with spices.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rules-of-the-rainbow-diet">Rules of the Rainbow Diet</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Most of your meals should contain a variety of brightly colored foods.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t skip meals. Eat three evenly spaced meals a day, plus one late-morning or late-afternoon snack. Make sure to finish your dinner in time to have three full hours to digest before going to bed.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid canned foods.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid saturated fats.</p></li>
<li><p>Read labels carefully; some “fat-free” foods are high in sugar and salt.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid pickled and smoked foods.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose lean meats, and trim fat wherever possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase your fiber intake.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink a variety of colored teas.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink only fresh-squeezed juice, not from concentrate.</p></li>
<li><p>Drink eight glasses of water each day.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid processed foods, such as white flour, salt, sugar, and soft drinks.</p></li>
<li><p>Eat yogurt daily.</p></li>
<li><p>Chew raw, crunchy foods such as celery, carrots, apples, and pears to feel satisfied.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exercise-reverses-all-of-your-aging-codes">Exercise Reverses All of Your Aging Codes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Dopamine Combats obesity; improves blood sugar and balance</p></li>
<li><p>Acetylcholine Improves memory, concentration, and overall cognition; increases blood flow to the brain</p></li>
<li><p>GABA Relieves anxiety and stress; helps regulate breathing; reduces pain</p></li>
<li><p>Serotonin Improves quality of sleep; combats depression</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise increases dopamine, and dopamine increases your desire to exercise, which raises overall energy in the body. The more you exercise, the more your body thinks it’s alive and the more you shut off the death codes.</p>
<p>Rainbow foods are nutrient dense with fewer empty calories than processed food. Brightly colored fruits, vegetables, grains, herbal teas, and spices are what make you feel satisfied and less likely to binge later.</p>
