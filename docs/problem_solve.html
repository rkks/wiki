<h2 id="problem-vs.exercise">Problem vs. Exercise</h2>
<p>Problem is a puzzle, to which you don’t know how to approach it to start with. Once you solve a problem, it becomes a repeated excercise from next time on, whenever you attempt at solving it again. Hence, someone’s problem could very well be an exercise for someone else, depending on whether they’ve faced similar issue in the past.</p>
<h2 id="approaching-a-new-problem">Approaching a new problem</h2>
<p>By its very nature, problem determination is about dealing with the unknown and the unexpected. If you knew in advance everything about all the problems that you could encounter and exactly how they manifest themselves, then you would’ve take measures to prevent them and wouldn’t have to investigate them. You cannot expect that problem determination should be a perfectly predictable process, but there are a number of common approaches that can make the process go smoother and be more effective.</p>
<p>Common challenges that can make problem determination exercises difficult to resolve:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Need for direction or What do I do next? - Problems can be complex and it is not always obvious how to approach them.</p></li>
<li><p>Need for information, or What does it mean? - Sometimes what’s missing is simply information: you have data, but you don’t know how to interpret it or can’t understand how it relates to the problem at hand.</p></li>
<li><p>Miscommunication and lack of organization, or ‘What was I doing? What were you doing’ - Sometimes time is wasted or important clues are lost because of miscommunication, or because the investigation has dragged on for so long, making the collected information more difficult to manage.</p></li>
<li><p>Dealing with multiple unrelated problems or symptoms, or What are we looking for? - A particular challenge in complex situations is not knowing whether you are dealing with a single problem or with multiple independent problems that happen to occur at the same time. Being able to distinguish between the noise and the real problems can go a long way to an timely resolution.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="characterizing-the-problem">Characterizing the problem</h2>
<p>Thumb rules of every news story - Who, What, When, Where, and Why.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What happened?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What are the main symptoms that determine the problem? How would the system behave if the problem is not present?</p></li>
<li><p>How would you recognize that the same problem happened again? How can you recreate it?</p></li>
<li><p>What information is required to analyze this problem? What are unknowns?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Where did it happen?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Precisely which machine, which application, which processes, and so on, the problem was observed on.</p></li>
<li><p>Which logs and which screens should you look at to see the problems?</p></li>
<li><p>What is network topology, system topology, software version, configurations, and other related factors.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>When did it happen?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Note time stamps of when problem happened, to look in the logs. Calculate time zone offsets. Check if dependent systems have clock synchronized.</p></li>
<li><p>Are there any special timing circumstances? Is the problem repeatable? Is problem</p></li>
<li><p>When does it needs to be fixed? What is the priority and whether that is valid?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Why did it happen?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Why did the problem happen now, and not earlier? What has changed? Has it ever worked correctly in the past?</p></li>
<li><p>Why does the problem happen only on this system, and not on other similar systems? What is different?</p></li>
<li><p>Why should this problem be fixed? What will happen if we don’t fix it?</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>Who is appropriate?</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Which technology area does it come into? Who is better person to analyze this problem?</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;note warning&gt;Be cautious about</p>
<ul>
<li><p>using vague terms like hang, crash, and fail, which are often generalizations, inaccurate, and distract attention away from important symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p>in real-world situations, there can be several independent problems rather than just one. You need to recognize them and prioritize them.</p></li>
<li><p>tangential problems that are consistent, well-known, and incidental. While source of problem lies elsewhere, these are mere consequences.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>&lt;/note&gt;</p>
<h2 id="not-every-problem-is-difficult">Not every problem is difficult</h2>
<p>Before jumping into complex analysis tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Phase 1 - perform a broad scan of the entire system to find any major error messages or dump files that have been generated in the recent past. Search those errors, dump traces, and initial symptoms across one or more knowledge bases of known problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Phase 2 - do everything else</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="balancing-resolution-and-relief">Balancing resolution and relief</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Resolution: Finding the root cause and ensuring that it will not happen again.</p></li>
<li><p>Relief: Enabling your users to resume productive work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, these two goals are not always simultaneously attainable. A simple reboot is often enough to bring the system back, but it can destroy information needed to debug the problem. In some situations, like system testing, driving the problem to full resolution is required and relief is not an issue. Whereas in business-critical production systems, immediate relief is paramount. Once the system is back up, investigation can begin with whatever data is available/salvaged.</p>
<p>&lt;note tip&gt;Person/team working on project must be clear about the business priorities and tradeoffs involved. While finding a frequently recurring problem might raise the importance of full resolution; however, finding a problem with too limited scope may tilt the scales toward simple relief.&lt;/note&gt;</p>
<p>Hence, before launching an in-depth investigation, you need to consider the business context in which the problems and your investigation occur.</p>
<h2 id="fundamental-approaches-analysis-and-isolation">Fundamental approaches: analysis and isolation</h2>
<p>While each problem and hence its investigation could be different, all troubleshooting exercises boil down to this: you watch a system that exhibits an abnormal or undesirable behavior, make observations and perform a sequence of steps to obtain more information to understand the causing factors, then devise and test a solution</p>
<p>Two distinct but complementary approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>analysis approach</strong> - you pick one or more specific symptoms or anomalies observed in system, and then drill down to gain more detailed information about these items and their causes. These, in turn, might lead to new, more specific symptoms or anomalies, which you further analyze until you reach a point where they are so simple or fundamental that it is clear what caused them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Techniques involved are reading source code/knowledge base, finding more specific symptoms, and research further.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>isolation approach</strong> - rather than focusing on one particular symptom and analyzing it in greater detail, you look at the context in which each symptom occurs within the overall system and its relation to other symptoms, and then attempt to simplify and eliminate factors until you are left with a set of factors so small and simple that, it is clear what caused the problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Techniques involved are performing specific experiments to observe system behavior for different inputs, narrow down the problem to few specific factors, reduce number of variables and inter-module dependencies in an attempt to see which parts are exactly contributing to the problem.</p>
<p>Although a clear distinction is made here between the analysis and isolation approaches, in practice they are not mutually exclusive. In the course of a complex investigation, you will often take steps from both approaches, either in succession or in parallel, to pursue multiple avenues of investigation at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="organizing-the-investigation">Organizing the investigation</h2>
<p>Four types of information are generally required:</p>
<h3 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h3>
<p>Summarizes the status of highest priority issues – what has been done, top action items, owners, approx. dates being chased, etc. This enables all stakeholders (not just executives) to understand the current status, helps focus the team, explains progress and next steps, and highlights any important discoveries, dependencies, and constraints.</p>
<h3 id="table-of-problems-symptoms-and-actions">Table of problems, symptoms, and actions</h3>
<p>Often problems are interlinked. While investigating one problem, several additional problems might surface. Record-keeping of these additional problems pays-off, especially when things are much more complicated than originally believed. Regardless of the exact format, this table should contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Problems: One entry for each problem that you are attempting to resolve (OR each thing that needs to be changed).</p></li>
<li><p>Symptoms: External manifestations of the underlying problem and anomalies that might provide a clue about the underlying problem. For ex. an error message observed in a log, or a particular pattern noticed in a system dump; the error condition or crash itself. They can be used as guide to verify the fix. Sometimes after fixing a problem, old symptoms go away, but new symptoms appear during an investigation.</p></li>
<li><p>Actions: Tasks to be performed that may or may not be directly related to a particular symptom or problem, e.g. upgrading the software or preparing a new test environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes: Alternatives to be tried to achieve a resolution or workaround.</p></li>
<li><p>Theories: It is useful to track ideas about why the problem is occurring or how it might be fixed. Noting which symptoms the theories are derived from can help rule out theories or draft new ones for the investigation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These tables should be constantly reviewed and updated to reflect current status of investigation. When there are multiple problems, it is also important to group symptoms with their corresponding problem, and to review these relationships frequently. Finally, each entry should be prioritized.</p>
<pre class="code"><code>  +------+----------+-------+-------------+-------------+---------------+
  |Prior | Problem  | #PR   | Symptoms    |  Status     | Actions       |
  +------+----------|-------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
  | #1   | App Crash|  123  |On Peak CPU  |Log Collected|Analyze logs   |
  +------+----------+-------+-------------+-------------+---------------+</code></pre>
<p>IMP: Do not attempt to use the table as a historical record of the progress and activities in the investigation. This table will typically be complex enough just keeping track of the current state of things. The timeline (covered next) will contain the historical information needed for most investigations.</p>
<h3 id="timeline-of-events">Timeline of events</h3>
<p>In any investigation that lasts more than a few days, or that involves more than a few individuals, there will invariably be questions about the results of some earlier experiment or trace, where some file was saved, and so on. Keep a log book in which you record a timeline of all major events that occurred during the investigation. A timeline will typically contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One entry for each occurrence of any problem being investigated.</p></li>
<li><p>One entry for each significant change made to the system (such as software upgrades, reinstalled applications, and so on).</p></li>
<li><p>One entry for each major diagnostic step taken (such as a test to reproduce the problem or experiment with a solution, a trace, and so on).</p></li>
<li><p>A precise date and time stamp.</p></li>
<li><p>A note of the systems (machines, servers, and so on) that were involved.</p></li>
<li><p>A note of where any diagnostic artifacts (logs, traces, dumps, and so on) were saved.</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<pre class="code"><code>  +------+----------+-------+-------------+-------------+---------------+
  |Event |Date/Time |      Details        |  Results    | Location      |
  +------+----------+---------------------+-------------|---------------|
  |Test#1|02/Sep 1PM|Analyze systest setup|Log Collected|/path/to/logs  |
  +------+----------+---------------------+-------------+---------------+
  |Test#2|4/Oct 5:00|Reproduce problem    |Register trac|               |
  +------+----------+---------------------+-------------+---------------+</code></pre>
<h3 id="inventory-of-the-diagnostic-artifacts">Inventory of the diagnostic artifacts</h3>
<p>Over the course of an investigation, one ends up collecting a large number of diagnostic artifacts and files, some could be result of multiple spontaneous occurrences of the problem over time, and others could be the result of specific experiments conducted to try to solve the problem or to gather additional information. It is very important to manage various diagnostic artifacts collected during these experiments so that they can be consulted when additional info is required to pursue a line of investigation. For each artifact, you should be able to tell:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Which event in the timeline does it correspond with?</p></li>
<li><p>Which specific machine or process (among all of the machines and processes involved in a given event) did the artifact come from?</p></li>
<li><p>What system or process configuration was in effect at the time the artifact was generated?</p></li>
<li><p>What options were used specifically to generate that artifact, if appropriate (for example, which trace settings)?</p></li>
<li><p>If the artifact is a log or trace file that could contain entries covering a long period of time, exactly at which time stamp(s) did something noteworthy happen in the overall system, that you might wish to correlate with entries in this log or trace file?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Organize all artifacts into subdirectories, with one subdirectory corresponding to each major event from the timeline, and to give each artifact within a directory a meaningful file name that reflects its type and source (machine, process, and so on). When necessary, also create a small README file associated with each artifact or directory that provides additional details about the circumstances when that artifact was generated (for example, configuration, options, detailed timestamps, and so on).</p>
<h2 id="avoiding-tunnel-vision">Avoiding tunnel vision</h2>
<p>Failure to see the whole picture and not methodically evaluating all potential solutions can result in prolonged relief and recovery times. Here are some ideas to help you avoid this condition:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Utilize checkpoints: Checkpoints are time-to-time team syncups required during the investigation. Create checkpoints for all team members to share all relevant findings since the last checkpoint. With this all team members will be in sync.</p></li>
<li><p>Work in parallel: Different team members can work parallely on alternative theories to the root cause, it can benefit the investigation by expediting it.</p></li>
<li><p>Regularly (re)ask the big picture questions: Keep asking ‘what is the problem?’ and ‘are we solving the right problem?’. One classic example of tunnel vision is thinking that you have reproduced a problem in a test environment only to discover later that it was actually a slight permutation of a production problem. Asking big picture questions can help contextualize problems and avoid chasing those that are of lesser priority.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="peeling-the-onion-the-nature-of-complex-problems">Peeling the onion: The nature of complex problems</h2>
<p>Often problems are relatively straightforward, with a single/small cluster of symptom(s) that lead more or less directly to an understanding of a single problem which, when fixed, resolves the entire situation. Sometimes, with more complex situations, a series of related symptoms or problems must be peeled back one-by-one to get to the root cause. The phenomenon of peeling the onion might manifest itself in a few different variations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Multiple problems or symptoms can be linked by a cause-and-effect relationship. Ex, web server is hung because it can’t create more connections, that is because of application server busy handling existing connections, that is because database server is slow, that is because network connection to db is slow, that is because an file-system replication is ongoing over that link.</p></li>
<li><p>Encountering one problem might cause the system to enter a particular error recovery path, and during the execution of that path another problem might manifest itself.</p></li>
<li><p>In other cases, one problem might simply mask another; the first problem does not let the system proceed past a certain point. But once that first problem is resolved, you get further into the processing and encounter a second independent problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In all these cases, there is no choice but to address one problem at a time, in the order that they are encountered, while observing the operation of the system. Each problem could itself require a lengthy sequence of investigative steps before it is understood. Once one problem is understood, you can proceed to the next problem in the sequence, and so on. This method can be very frustrating, especially to those unfamiliar with the troubleshooting process, but effective communication can help keep morale high and build trust in the process by showing concrete progress and minimizing confusion.</p>
<p>&lt;note important&gt;Maintaining and publishing a clear executive summary helps set the context of the overall situation, helps highlight each specific problem when it has been resolved so that progress is evident, and helps identify new (major) problems as they are discovered. The table of problems, symptoms and actions helps to keep track of the various layers and clarify the relationship between similar problems and symptoms.&lt;/note&gt;</p>
<p>Problem determination is about dealing with the unknown and unexpected, and so it will probably never be an exact science, but it’s also not rocket science. By following more organized and systematic way to problem determination, in end it can be more effective and rewarding.</p>
