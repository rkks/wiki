<h3 id="rule-1">Rule #1</h3>
<p>Braces – Braces ({ }) shall always surround the blocks of code (also known as compound statements) following if, else, switch, while, do, and for keywords. Single statements and empty statements following these keywords shall also always be surrounded by braces.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Considerable risk is associated with the presence of empty statements and single statements that are not surrounded by braces. Code constructs of this type are often associated with bugs when nearby code is changed or commented out. This type of bug is entirely eliminated by the consistent use of braces.</p>
<h3 id="rule-2">Rule #2</h3>
<p>Keyword “const” – The const keyword shall be used whenever possible, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To declare variables that should not be changed after initialization,</p></li>
<li><p>To define call-by-reference function parameters that should not be modified (for example, char const * p_data),</p></li>
<li><p>To define fields in structs and unions that cannot be modified (such as in a struct overlay for memory-mapped I/O peripheral registers), and</p></li>
<li><p>As a strongly typed alternative to #define for numerical constants.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The upside of using const as much as possible is compiler-enforced protection from unintended writes to data that should be read-only. NOTE: A “const” definition requires memory space to store the value, and processor cyles to fetch it from memory - whereas a #define may be coded as an immediate value. This is the downside of defining numerical constants as ‘const’. Instead ‘enums’ are better.</p>
<h3 id="rule-3">Rule #3</h3>
<p>Keyword “static” – The static keyword shall be used to declare all functions and variables that do not need to be visible outside of the module in which they are declared.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> C’s static keyword has several meanings. At the module-level, global variables and functions declared static are protected from inadvertent access from other modules. Heavy-handed use of static in this way thus decreases coupling and furthers encapsulation.</p>
<h3 id="rule-4">Rule #4</h3>
<p>Keyword “volatile” – The volatile keyword shall be used whenever appropriate, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>To declare a global variable accessible (by current use or scope) by any interrupt service routine,</p></li>
<li><p>To declare a global variable accessible (by current use or scope) by two or more tasks, and</p></li>
<li><p>To declare a pointer to a memory-mapped I/O peripheral register set (for example, timer_t volatile * const p_timer).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Proper use of volatile eliminates a whole class of difficult-to-detect bugs by preventing the compiler from making optimizations that would eliminate requested reads or writes to variables or registers that may be changed at any time by a parallel-running entity.</p>
<h3 id="rule-5">Rule #5</h3>
<p>Comments – Comments shall neither be nested nor used to disable a block of code, even temporarily. To temporarily disable a block of code, use the pre-processor’s conditional compilation feature (for example, #if 0 … #endif).</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Nested comments and commented-out code both run the risk of allowing unexpected snippets of code to be compiled into the final executable.</p>
<h3 id="rule-6">Rule #6</h3>
<p>Fixed-width data types – Whenever the width, in bits or bytes, of an integer value matters in the program, a fixed-width data type shall be used in place of char, short, int, long, or long long. The signed and unsigned fixed-width integer types shall be as shown in Table 1.</p>
<pre class="code"><code>  Table 1
  Integer Width   Signed  Unsigned
  8 bits/1 byte   int8_t  uint8_t
  16 bits/2 bytes int16_t uint16_t
  32 bits/4 bytes int32_t uint32_t
  64 bits/8 bytes int64_t uint64_t</code></pre>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The ISO C standard allows implementation-defined widths for char, short, int, long, and long long types, which leads to portability problems. Though the 1999 standard did not change this underlying issue, it did introduce the uniform type names shown in the table, which are defined in the new header file &lt;stdint.h&gt;. These are the names to use even if you have to create the typedefs by hand.</p>
<h3 id="rule-7">Rule #7</h3>
<p>Bit-wise operators – None of the bit-wise operators (in other words, &amp;, |, ~, ^, «, and ») shall be used to manipulate signed integer data.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The C standard does not specify the underlying format of signed data (for example, 2’s complement) and leaves the effect of some bit-wise operators to be defined by the compiler author.</p>
<h3 id="rule-8">Rule #8</h3>
<p>Signed and unsigned integers – Signed integers shall not be combined with unsigned integers in comparisons or expressions. In support of this, decimal constants meant to be unsigned should be declared with a ‘u’ at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Several details of the manipulation of binary data within signed integer containers are implementation-defined behaviors of the C standard. Additionally, the results of mixing signed and unsigned data can lead to data-dependent bugs.</p>
<h3 id="rule-9">Rule #9</h3>
<p>Parametrized macros vs. inline functions – Parameterized macros shall not be used if an inline function can be written to accomplish the same task.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> There are a lot of risks associated with the use of preprocessor #defines, and many of them relate to the creation of parameterized macros. The extensive use of parentheses (as shown in the example) is important, but doesn’t eliminate the unintended double increment possibility of a call such as MAX(i++, j++). Other risks of macro misuse include comparison of signed and unsigned data or any test of floating-point data.</p>
<h3 id="rule-10">Rule #10</h3>
<p>Comma operator – The comma (,) operator shall not be used within variable declarations.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The cost of placing each declaration on a line of its own is low. By contrast, the risk that either the compiler or a maintainer will misunderstand your intentions is high.</p>
<p>&lt;note tip&gt;Complex variable declarations are common, but can be difficult to comprehend. Reading declaration from “right-to-left” simplifies the translation into English. Eg. timer_t volatile * const p_timer; ⇐ “p_timer is a constant pointer to a volatile timer_t” register set. i.e., address of timer registers is fixed while the contents of those registers may change at any time.&lt;/note&gt;</p>
<h3 id="rule-11">Rule #11</h3>
<p>Keywords “short” and “long” – The keywords short and long shall not be used.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> The ANSI/ISO C standard contains a set of strict requirements plus mere guidelines for the authors of C compilers. Among the guidelines (also known as “implementation-defined” behaviors) are the precise width, in bits, of the char, short, int, and long data types. ISO C mandates that variables of type short must hold at least 16 bits and long at least 32 bits, across all platforms. Other than that, the only strict requirement is that sizeof(char) ⇐ sizeof(short) ⇐ sizeof(int) ⇐ sizeof(long). There are times when you must use char (see Rule #12). In other places (e.g., loop counter declarations), it makes sense to allow the compiler to choose the best/fastest width using int. But in keeping with Rule #6 concerning adoption of the C99 fixed-width integer types/names, it is appropriate to ban use of the short and long types altogether. Like the semi-colon followed by left-brace sequence above, an automated tool can be used to enforce this rule.</p>
<h3 id="rule-12">Rule #12</h3>
<p>Keyword “char” – Use of the keyword char shall be restricted to the declaration of and operations concerning strings.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Among the implementation-defined behaviors of C is the signed-ness of a char data type. One compiler may treat your char variables as unsigned, another as signed—and yet both are technically ISO C compliant! This introduces subtle and potentially hidden risks related to using the bit-wise operators on signed char data (Rule #7) or mixing signed and unsigned data (Rule #8). The risk of bugs derived from this subtlety of C are entirely eliminated by choosing int8_t or uint8_t explicitly whenever the data is other than part or all of a string.</p>
<h3 id="rule-13">Rule #13</h3>
<p>Initialization of variables – All variables shall be initialized before use.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Too many C programmers assume the C run-time will watch out for them. This is a very bad assumption, which can prove dangerous in a real-time system. We may sometimes get lucky with C startup code that zeros all uninitialized data or the stack. But lucky is not acceptable in a medical device or any other safety-critical product. By making initialization before use a hard rule on your project, you elevate the warning a static-analysis tool can raise on this to an error that must be dealt with by the team.</p>
<h3 id="rule-14">Rule #14</h3>
<p>Global variable names – The names of all global variables shall begin with the letter ‘g’. For example, g_zero_offset.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> Eschew them all you like, but global variables are a fact of life in some parts of embedded software. There are two specific risks associated with their use. The first risk of global variables is that a race condition between two or more asynchronous entities (be they CPUs, peripherals, ISRs, tasks, or a combination) will corrupt the data stored there. To prevent this, exclusive access must be established programmatically, such as via use of interrupt disables or mutex acquisition. The second risk is that the compiler will optimize away one entity’s read or write because it cannot see the other user during compilation. Both risks can be eliminated, but only if everyone on the team sees that they are global variables. By naming all globals in an obvious way, code reviews become that much more effective—all the way down to the individual line of code or function.</p>
<h3 id="rule-15">Rule #15</h3>
<p>Constants in comparisons – When evaluating the equality or inequality of a variable with a constant value, always place the constant value on the left side of the comparison operator.</p>
<p><strong>Reasoning:</strong> It is always desirable to detect possible typos and as many other bugs as possible at compile-time; run-time discovery may be dangerous to the user of the product and require significant effort to locate. By following this rule, the compiler can detect erroneous attempts to assign (i.e., = instead of == ) a new value to a constant.</p>
