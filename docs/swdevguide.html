<p>Automated Systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Revision Control System - Git</p></li>
<li><p>Continuous Integration - RCS update, Nightly/Hourly build, Sanity test, Coding standards checks, Tagging</p></li>
<li><p>Bug Tracking System - What features are being built, tested, approved, troublesome? What outstanding issues are there? How critical?</p></li>
<li><p>Patching System - How new changes are propagated to nightly tester hardware and/or software? You don’t want to uninstall-install each time.</p></li>
<li><p>Release Qualification System - Pulling out test branch, generating builds for SysTest, tracking changes to it, stabilizing it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Specification Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Clarity than Intelligence - Keep it concise, precise, and comprehensive. No ambiguous, unquantified, unqualified requirements.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it rigorous - It should address almost all aspects of the product. If something isn’t addressed, it wouldn’t be done.</p></li>
<li><p>Document corner cases - Identify technology corner cases, system issues, dependencies, bottlenecks early on.</p></li>
<li><p>Have enough eye balls - Involve all stake holders to review it. More the review, better the clarity.</p></li>
<li><p>Say what not how - A spec should only address WHAT needs to be done and possibly WHY, but certainly not HOW. Give developers freedom.</p></li>
<li><p>Outcomes should be tangible - Specify the outcome that is verifiable, document-able, testable, and that can be mapped to requirements.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>User Interface Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Set user’s expectations right - Make it clear of what he can expect from product.</p></li>
<li><p>Less is more - More options you provide to user, more confused he will be. Keep interface slim.</p></li>
<li><p>Consistency is the key - Consistent user interface and organized information is user friendly and clean.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep noise to minimum - Only throw messages, prompts and information that user must know.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid acronyms - WTF could mean “What The Fun” to you, but not necessarily same to your user.</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback is friend - Keep feedback providing as easy as possible for user.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Product Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>System works if everything works - Test every possible combination of usage that is expected to work. Be explicit on what doesn’t work.</p></li>
<li><p>Initial expression has great impression - Product should work when run first time, keep configurables to minimum. Keep it intelligent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Coding Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write readable code - Consistency, Readability, Well formatted code is not an option, but a necessity. Coding conventions are for everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>Input sanitization is must - Put rigorous checks on all input interfaces. They are main entry points for exploits.</p></li>
<li><p>Data structures are key - Better data organization simplifies code logic. Use tried and tested structures.</p></li>
<li><p>Variables - Require careful scoping, ease of access, synchronized, and friendly naming conventions.</p></li>
<li><p>Global variables - Should be minimum, all in one place, and modularized (to avoid synchronization bottlenecks).</p></li>
<li><p>Locks - Must be handled automatically by pre-defined functions and trackers. Keep reference counting.</p></li>
<li><p>Functions - Keep them thread-safe, reentrant, input sanitized, output validated, well defined, traceable, and with user friendly naming.</p></li>
<li><p>Comments - At a ratio of 30% comment to 70% code. Not a story, not a dictation of program, only “logic, assumptions, constraints”.</p></li>
<li><p>Logging - Must for all softwares. Should be enough to trace any basic faults in system.</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing - Must for run-time analysis of software. Trace points should include key data structure values at trace junctions.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory accounting - Necessary to track number of allocations, frees, used memory, free memory, control requests, responses, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>CPU accounting - Necessary on per thread basis to avoid CPU thrashing and to allow time critical things to be run smoothly.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check for memory errors - Off-by-one errors, Stack overflow errors,</li>
</ul>
<p>Interview Guidelines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Do new candidates write code during their interview?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you do hallway usability testing?</p></li>
<li><p>Do programmers have quiet working conditions?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you use the best tools money can buy?</p></li>
<li><p>Do you have testers?</p></li>
</ul>
<!-- end list -->
<pre class="code"><code>  Help strengthen your team by surveying your computing “neighborhood.” Choose two or three “broken windows” and discuss with your colleagues what the problems are and what could be done to fix them.</code></pre>
<pre class="code"><code>  Can you tell when a window first gets broken? What is your reaction? If it was the result of someone else’s decision, or a management edict, what can you do about it?</code></pre>
<p>Why is it worthy to look into code that is already working?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working doesn’t really mean correct. It may not really be working, just working due to undiscovered bugs or boundary conditions or just lucky.</p></li>
<li><p>Undocumented behavior that you rely upon may change with the next release of the library. Try not to use undocumented api’s. If you must, then document your assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p>Additional and unnecessary calls make code slower and also increase the risk of introducing new bugs of their own.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>How to program deliberately?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Always be aware of what you are doing.</p></li>
<li><p>Attempting to build an application you don’t fully understand OR to use a technology you aren’t familiar with, is an invitation to be misled by coincidences.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed from a plan, whether that plan is in your head, on the back of a cocktail napkin, or on a wall-sized printout from a CASE tool.</p></li>
<li><p>Rely only on reliable things. Don’t depend on accidents or assumptions. If you can’t tell the difference in particular circumstances, assume the worst.</p></li>
<li><p>Document your assumptions. Design by Contract, can help clarify your assumptions in your own mind, as well as help communicate them to others.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t just test your code, but test your assumptions as well. Don’t guess; actually try it. Write an assertion to test your assumptions. If your assertion is right, you have improved the documentation in your code. If you discover your assumption is wrong, then count yourself lucky.</p></li>
<li><p>Prioritize your effort. Spend time on the important aspects; more than likely, these are the hard parts. If you don’t have fundamentals or infrastructure correct, brilliant bells and whistles will be irrelevant.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t be a slave to history. Don’t let existing code dictate future code. All code can be replaced if it is no longer appropriate. Even within one program, don’t let what you’ve already done constrain what you do next—be ready to refactor. This decision may impact the project schedule. The assumption is that the impact will be less than the cost of not making the change.</p></li>
