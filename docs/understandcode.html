<p>For what it’s worth, I had a professional reputation (with my management) as being good at that, and I did a lot of support programming fixing other people’s code.</p>
<p>But it’s hard to come up with tips, because they depend on the code you’re reading. Here are a few ideas:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Read the comments. If the references are obscure, don’t kill yourself (or your available time) trying to understand them, but pick up any clues that are readily available.</p></li>
<li><p>Don’t trust the comments. They might not have been accurate when written, and they also might not have been maintained when the code was revised.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for interfaces: input, output, parameters, returned values. See what’s actually produced.</p></li>
<li><p>Look for side effects. Sometimes they’re the point. (I wish I could say that the comments always explain that, but rule (2) prohibits me from doing so.)</p></li>
<li><p>Try to get a “feel” for what the variables represent in relation to the code’s design. Again, maybe there are comments to help–and again, maybe they can’t be trusted.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>One of the barriers to reading someone else’s code is learning to accept someone else’s variable names. It’s like doing a cryptogram: you have to get used to the fact that, for this particular case, L represents what you’d write as T, and so on. You’re trying to think someone else’s thoughts instead of your own.</p>
<ol start="6" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Look for structure; that is, mentally divide the code into sections and try to get a grasp of what each does. Well-written code should naturally lend itself to this. Some code doesn’t.</p></li>
<li><p>Withhold judgment on things that are designed differently from the way you’d do them, at least until you are sure exactly what they do. See source for a relevant quote.</p></li>
<li><p>Always be on the lookout for something (a technique, a style, an algorithm) you can learn from the code you’re reading. It’s not always there, but looking for it can help your understanding anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Use scratch paper. Better yet, print out the code and mark up your copy as needed to clarify structure. I frequently used highlighting in multiple colors as an analysis tool.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Source(s): A yielding, an obedience, a willingness to accept these notes as the right notes, this pattern as the true pattern, is the essential gesture of performance, translation, and understanding. The gesture need not be permanent, a lasting posture of the mind or heart; yet it is not false. It is more than the suspension of disbelief needed to watch a play, yet less than a conversion. It is a position, a posture in the dance. – Ursula K. Le Guin, “The Telling”</p>
