  - Technology Serves Humans - Technology serves humans; Humans do not
    serve technology.

  - The Experience Belongs to the User - Designers do not create
    experiences, they create artifacts to experience.

  - Design is not Art - The highest accolade we can bestow on a design
    is not that it is beautiful, as we do in Art, but that it is
    well-used.

  - Great Design is Invisible - An interesting property of great design
    is that it is taken for granted. It works so well that we forget
    that creative effort was involved to bring it about. Because of its
    success, great design is often invisible.

  - Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication - “In anything at all,
    perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.” That is
    the highest achievement for a designer.
