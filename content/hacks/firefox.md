## Firefox go to a website keyboard shortcut

One of the best options in Firefox is keyword bookmarking - you basically save
the website to your Firefox bookmarks and then assign a (memorable) keyword to
that bookmark.

Do: Bookmarks->point to a bookmark->properties
Assign a keyword.

Make it a habit to work on a single tab or a single webpage.

## Firefox Restore Session Error Handling

If on the firefox homepage, "Restore Previous Session" button doesn't work,
then delete chromeappsstore.sqlite file in profiles folder. :)

To restart firefox with all addons disabled, do: help->Restart with Addons
Disabled.
