*“There is no great anti-brain environment than the classroom and
cubicle”* **- Dr. John Medina**  

*“If you want to get particulars correct, don't start with details.
Start with key ideas and in hierarchical fashion, form the details
around these notions.”* **- Dr. John Medina**  

*“Do something emotionally relevant at each 10-minute mark to regain
attention. Tell a story, show a relevant video, do a relevant activity,
etc.”* **- Dr. John Medina**

*“The brain pays attention to patterns. Remembering something we've seen
before (like quicksand) is a useful evolutionary trait.”* **- Dr. John
Medina**. So, Tell what you want to tell, tell it, Reiterate what you
just told - Successful presentation.

Biggest problem with presentations:

*“Relating \_too much information\_, with not enough time devoted to
connecting the dots. Lots of force feeding, very little digestion”* **-
Dr. John Medina**

*“Pictures beat text .. because reading is so inefficient for us. We
have to identify certain features in the letters to be able to read
them. That takes time”* **- Dr. John Medina**

**Rule 1:** *Excercise boosts brain power.*

1.  Our brains were built for walking/moving.

2.  To improve your thinking skills, move\!

3.  Exercise gets blood to brain, bringing it glucose and oxygen.

4.  Aerobic exercise 2x/week halves the risk of general dementia,
    reduces the risk of Alzheimer's by 60%.

5.  Exercise is just about the best thing you can do for yourself says
    Dr. Medina.

**Rule 4:** *We don't pay attention to boring things.*

1.  No mutitasking. When it comes to attention, its only one thing at a
    time.

2.  We are better at seeing patterns, abstracting meaning than recording
    details.

3.  Tapping people's emotions helps them learn.

4.  People start to fade after 10 minutes. Get them back by telling
    stories, examples and targeting their emotions.

**Rule 10:** *Vision trumps all other senses.*

1.  Vision is our dominant sense, using half of the brain's resources.

2.  We learn/remember best through pictures compared to text or spoken
    words.

3.  Try to communicate more with pictures.

4.  Toss your current powerpoint slides.
