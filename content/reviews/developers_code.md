## The Developer's code - What real programmers do

* Follow metaphors with care - Metaphors/analogies are good for understand
things in more familiar way. But taking it too far can lead to bad decisions.
Something that works really well in some other area/field might not work in
software. Hence, when you talk of analogy or somebody uses metaphor to
describe things, be very careful.

* Don't get clutched in planning - In fields like construction, cost of redoing
something is high and that of a mistake is much higher. But in our field cost
of redoing is much less and that of a mistake depends on area of work. Hence,
it is not required that everything be sorted beforehand. Don't hesistate to
experiment with things and find out a practical and legitimate solution for a
problem.

* It makes sense for architect to involve in development activities - One can
think of best design patterns, best architecture, best practices, but myraid
of real challenges uncover only when you are deep into code. Hence, defining
an architecture/design shoud be an ongoing activity where you need to refine
OR redefine your architecture/design from time to time depending on problem
horizon. At worse, you may also have to update your spec in corner cases.

* Make work exciting by avoiding duplicacy - Automated build tools, code
sanitizers, code format checkers, code generators, sanity testers and many
more can be invented to make work more fun doing.

* Don't keep commented code - You can always get back the commented code from
version control.

* Specialization matters - Though you may know various adjacent areas of
technology, keep one or two area of specialization as key.

* Imperfection is a bliss - Always strive for excellence, not perfection.
Perfection is an endless pursuit of a illusional goal.

Author doesn't have much experience in variety of fields. It doesn't seem to be
worthy to read it completely.
