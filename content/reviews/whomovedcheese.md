  - Enjoy change.

  - Be ready to change quickly, again and again.

  - When you move beyond your fear, you feel free.

  - Imagining myself enjoying New Cheese, even before I find it, leads
    me to it.

These are some real-life cheese rules.

1.  Never give your old cheese away in anticipation of finding new
    cheese.

2.  Never turn down cheese offered to you, even if you already have too
    much.

3.  Never turn down cheese offered to you just because you've never seen
    that kind before and have no idea what to do with it. When someone
    brings unfamiliar cheese to you, your response should be “I've done
    this many times.”

4.  Don't let anyone else know you've found some cheese.

5.  Don't share your cheese.

6.  Cheese can go away at any time without notice, hence \#5.

7.  Cheese can go bad at any time. When this happens, disregard \#5 and
    go ahead and share your cheese. An added benefit of this is that it
    will appear as if you're finding cheese for others (Hey? isn't this
    what the managers are supposed to be doing?) and you'll be a hero.

8.  Do not ask for tools (e.g. software, or a computer that is at least
    as fast as the secretary's) that will help you bring in new cheese.

9.  Do not expect your head cheese (i.e. manager, but we wanted to use
    the word cheese as much as possible) to find you cheese. You are
    expected to find the cheese. (Just where did you think they get
    their overhead?)

10. If you let your head cheese find you some cheese, it will be out in
    the desert\*, or maybe even out of state (remember - out of state,
    out of mind. Umm, actually I just made that up).

11. Be careful. Just because it looks like cheese and/or smells like
    cheese, it may not actually be cheese. (This reminds us of the
    Cheech and Chong dog story. If you don't know who Cheech and Chong
    are then go to an antique store and try to find one of their records
    Or you could look at their website)

12. If you run out of cheese you'll be assigned to do self-assessments
    until you learn not to run out of cheese.

13. The self-assessments will take all of your time so you will not be
    able to look for new cheese.

14. Did you ever think that maybe they keep moving the cheese because
    they don't want you to find it?

And finally,

1.  Never cut the cheese (oh come on, you were thinking this yourself).

Other Cheese-Related Thoughts

  - Always activate your screen-saver when you walk away from your
    computer. This will prevent others from entering your office while
    you're out and discovering that you actually have cheese.

  - Remember, cheese spelled backwards is eseehc.
