The following questions should stimulate thought when developing a WBS
to manage the project:

1.  Think through the entire project. (Look at dividing high-level
    deliverables.)

2.  Think deliverables. (What is to be provided/what is required?)

3.  Think with the end in mind. (How will this component contribute to
    the finished deliverable?)

4.  Think through the production of the deliverables. (What methods?
    What special processes? What quality requirements? What
    inspections?)

5.  Have you formulated a vision of the final product in your mind?

6.  What are its constituent parts?

7.  How do the pieces work together?

8.  What needs to be done?

The following steps describe the general process for developing a WBS:

1.  **Step 1**: Identify the final product(s) of the project—what must
    be delivered to achieve project success. A thorough review of
    high-level project scope documents (inputs such as statement of work
    \[SOW\], technical requirements documents, and so on) is recommended
    to ensure consistency between the WBS and the project requirements.

2.  **Step 2**: Define the product’s major deliverables, which are often
    predecessor deliverables necessary for the project, but that in
    themselves do not satisfy a business need (e.g., a design
    specification).

3.  **Step 3**: Decompose major deliverables to a level of detail
    appropriate for management and integrated control. These WBS
    elements normally tie to clear and discrete identification of
    stand-alone deliverable products.

4.  **Step 4**: Review and refine the WBS until project stakeholders
    agree that project planning can be successfully completed and that
    execution and control will successfully produce the desired
    outcomes.

## FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED

In developing a WBS, the following basic assumptions should be
considered:

1.  Each WBS element should represent a single tangible deliverable.

2.  Each WBS element should represent an aggregation of all subordinate
    WBS elements listed immediately below it.

3.  Each subordinate WBS element must belong to only one single parent
    (or superior) WBS element.

4.  The deliverables should be logically decomposed to the level that
    represents how they will be produced (designed, purchased,
    subcontracted, fabricated). The partitioning of deliverables from
    higher levels within the WBS to lower levels must be logically
    related.

5.  Deliverables must be unique and distinct from their peers, and
    should be decomposed to the level of detail needed to plan and
    manage the work to obtain or create them.

6.  Deliverables should be clearly defined to eliminate duplication of
    effort within WBS elements, across organizations, or between
    individuals responsible for completing the work.

7.  Deliverables should be limited in size and definition for effective
    control—but not so small as to make cost of control excessive and
    not so large as to make the item unmanageable or the risk
    unacceptable.

8.  The WBS development process should provide a vehicle for
    flexibility, particularly when the scope of the project effort may
    change. A well-managed project, however, will incorporate a rigorous
    change control process to document and manage scope changes. When
    work scope changes do take place, the WBS must be updated.

9.  Each entry in the WBS representing subcontracted or externally
    committed deliverables should directly correspond to matching
    entries in the subcontractor’s WBS.

10. All deliverables are explicitly included in the WBS.

11. All significant reporting items (e.g., review meetings, monthly
    reports, test reports, and so on) are included and identified in the
    WBS.

12. All WBS elements should be compatible with organizational and
    accounting structures.

13. A coding scheme for WBS elements that clearly represents the
    hierarchical structure when viewed in text format should be used.

14. Technical input should be obtained from knowledgeable technical
    subject matter experts (SMEs), and communicated to and validated by
    other key SMEs assigned to the project.

## WBS MEASUREMENT CONSIDERATIONS

It is strongly recommended that project management activities foster
measurement of work accomplishment, as opposed to goal achievement by
providing an integrated view across project components. Proper linking
between the WBS and associated cost and schedule is critical if
integrated analysis of cost, schedule, and performance is to be
accomplished.

1.  Cost and schedule impacts can be determined only if there is a clear
    link between performance parameters and budgeted work packages via
    the WBS. This link is accomplished in order to obtain a “performance
    budget baseline” or the budget associated at the work package level.

2.  All work in the WBS must be estimated, resourced, scheduled,
    budgeted, and controlled. The WBS has two parts: the structure and
    the component definition. It is the mechanism that divides and
    organizes the work scope into units of work so that each unit can be
    estimated, resourced, scheduled, budgeted, and controlled while
    progress is reported.

3.  Where there is a clear link between performance parameters and
    budgeted work packages via the WBS, the linkage should be made at a
    high level within the WBS. All work packages can then be associated
    with the performance parameters.

4.  Separate WBS elements should be included for integration tasks where
    several components are being brought together to create a
    higher-level WBS element. By identifying the integration work
    separately where ever the above occurs, performance measurement
    information will provide a timely indication that problems are
    emerging. Cost and schedule variances occurring in WBS elements that
    contain integration work can also indicate potential future rework
    in areas that have previously been completed. When these trends are
    projected, the result could be a far greater impact on revised
    estimates at completion than from projections of trends in other
    areas. Technical experts can

5.  provide guidance regarding potential integration problems, which can
    help the project manager decide whether or not to create these
    separate integration and assembly (I\&A) WBS elements.

6.  Identification and tracking of performance metrics in a disciplined
    and systematic fashion helps provide significant early warning of
    potential problems and their nature.

## CHALLENGES TO BE CONSIDERED

Challenges associated with developing the WBS include:

1.  Balancing the project definition aspects of the WBS with the data
    collecting and reporting requirements. (Remember that the primary
    purpose of the WBS is to define the project’s scope through the
    decomposition of deliverables.) Each WBS is a tool designed to
    assist the project manager with decomposition of the project only to
    the levels necessary to meet the needs of the project, the nature of
    the work, and the confidence of the team. Excessive WBS levels may
    require unrealistic levels of maintenance and reporting.

2.  Developing a WBS that defines the logical relationships among all
    the components of the project. This is generally clarified through
    the use of a dependency network in the project schedule.

3.  Ensuring the development and utilization of the WBS. Omitting WBS
    development and proceeding directly to the network diagram (such as
    a Gantt chart, CPM Schedule, or Precedence Diagram) may lead to
    unforeseen and unexpected difficulty, including project delay.

4.  Avoiding the creation of WBS elements that are not
    deliverable-focused (for example, structuring the WBS strictly by
    process or organization). WBS elements that are not
    deliverable-focused may lead to project failure.

5.  Defining WBS elements representing opening and closing stages such
    as planning, assembly, and testing.

6.  Identifying and detailing all key project deliverables (e.g.,
    regulatory permits, packaging, distribution, or marketing).

7.  Preventing the use of WBS elements that define overlapping
    responsibilities for the creation of a deliverable(s). Each WBS
    element must have one person who is clearly accountable for its
    completion.

8.  Identifying key project management work such as:
    
    1.  process management
    
    2.  services and provisioning
    
    3.  information/communication
    
    4.  administrative documentation, training, and software.

## Determining Appropriate WBS Level of Detail

Should the WBS be decomposed further? Questions for consideration:

  - Is there a need to improve the accuracy of the cost and duration
    estimates of the WBS element?

  - Is more than one individual or group responsible for the WBS
    element? While there may be a variety of resources assigned to a WBS
    element, there should be one individual assigned overall
    responsibility for the deliverable created during the completion of
    the WBS element.

  - Does the WBS element content include more than one type of work
    process or more than one deliverable?

  - Is there a need to precisely know the timing of work processes
    internal to the WBS element?

  - Is there a need to separately define the cost of work processes or
    deliverables internal to the WBS element?

  - Are there dependencies between deliverables within a WBS element to
    another WBS element?

  - Are there significant time gaps in the execution of the work
    processes internal to the WBS element?

  - Do resource requirements change over time within a WBS element?

  - Do prerequisites differ among internal deliverables within the WBS
    element?

  - Are clear, objective criteria missing for measuring progress for the
    WBS element?

  - Are there acceptance criteria applicable before the completion of
    the entire WBS element?

  - Are there specific risks that require focused attention to a portion
    of the WBS element?

  - Can a portion of the work to be performed within the WBS element be
    scheduled as a unit?

  - Is the WBS element clearly and completely understood to the
    satisfaction of the project manager, project team members, and other
    stakeholders—including the customer?

  - Is there a stakeholder interested in analyzing status and
    performance of only a portion of the work covered by the WBS
    element?

## The Relationship between Project Risk and the WBS

The following questions should be addressed for each WBS element when
considering project risk:

  - Are the deliverables completely and clearly defined?

  - Will the quality of the work be evaluated through efforts such as
    testing and inspection?

  - What is the likelihood of change?

  - Is the technology changing faster than the project can be
    accomplished?

  - Have manpower, facilities capability, availability of internal
    resources, and potential suppliers been checked?

  - Is extensive subcontracting expected?

  - Is management committed to the project and will they provide the
    support needed?

  - Are requirements defined and approved?

  - Has a formal change process been defined and implemented?

  - Have metrics been defined for how the deliverables will be measured?

  - Have resource requirements been identified for development of the
    project deliverables?

  - Have other risks been identified, including stakeholder buy-in,
    public relations, management approval, team understanding, and
    project opposition?

  - Has a communication plan (internal and external) been defined and
    implemented?

  - Are third-party dependencies understood and monitored for change?

  - Have alternate suppliers of required products, supplies, or
    expertise been identified?

## Resource Planning and Management

In order to prepare for adequate resource planning against the WBS,
consider the following when examining the WBS level of detail:

  - Is all the work planned to a degree of detail necessary to make and
    keep commitments?

  - Is there an ability to establish and manage individual work
    assignments with the reporting structure indicated by this WBS?

  - Can work assignments be established from a progressive expansion of
    the WBS?

  - How will work generally be assigned and controlled?

  - Will it be possible to reconcile individual work assignments to the
    formal scheduling system?

  - How will budgets be established?

  - Will it be possible to relate the budget to the proposed work
    assignments?

  - Is the level of detail in the WBS appropriate for effective planning
    and control?

  - Is the work defined by the WBS grouped in a logical manner?

  - Is more than one organization involved (indicating the need to
    validate the WBS with others before doing detailed resource
    planning)?

  - How will the status of work in progress be determined?
