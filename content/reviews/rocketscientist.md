The very first secret about rocket scientists is that they are not in it
for the money. They are in it for the fun. They are the biggest dreamers
on Earth because they dream on a cosmic scale. And they love sci-ﬁ books
and movies.

  - Forget about your fears, the facts, looking silly or stupid—and test
    your ability to dream. Don't be afraid of looking silly. Be like
    children who want to hear the same fairy tale, then imagination
    wouldn't look silly to you.

  - Find your big picture and it will give your task perspective and
    joy. The big picture focuses your mind and subconscious on a larger
    purpose. It gives meaning to all the little tasks you must tend to
    in order to achieve your goal. Keep your big picture in mind when
    solving your problems. The big picture will help you take the next
    step—it will give you direction.

  - Since you must aim, why not aim the biggest? Have dreams of gigantic
    scale. You may not always achieve those goals, but you never hit a
    target that you don’t aim at. Ernest Shackleton, the polar explorer,
    aimed high. Shackleton failed in nearly every mission he launched,
    and yet he is considered today to be the greatest of the Antarctic
    explorers. He aimed high, but he changed his plans to ﬁt the
    circumstances—he didn’t believe in Pyrrhic victories, and he didn’t
    lose a man in his command.

  - Unfortunately, when we talk about creativity, about generating new
    ideas, and about solving difﬁ cult problems, most people become
    stiff and formal. There is a strong tendency to become judgmental
    and critical, to get serious, and to not be creative at all. This is
    mainly because they are afraid to offend, to make a mistake, to
    appear irreverent or nonchalant, to look silly. And thus, you just
    can’t be creative when someone tells you to be creative. BS is
    making stuff up, telling stories, trying to amuse, and is definitely
    irreverent. We all do it. BS is fun, BS is playful, BS is creativity
    without constraints. You can’t get away with BSing your way through
    with just any BS. It’s got to be good BS. You’ve got to be able to
    sniff out the wheat from the chaff.

  - The ﬁrst step to knowledge—to ﬁnding the answer—is to eliminate what
    isn’t true. Brainstorming consists of making a long list of
    possibilities. The goal is to create as many ideas (the good, the
    bad, and the ugly) as you can, to make your list as long as
    possible. No idea, no matter how absurd, stupid, ridiculous, or
    silly, should be discarded. Absolutely no judgment should be made at
    this stage. Give your creativity (and everyone else’s) free rein.
    Don’t take the process too seriously. Don’t be afraid to play with
    ideas. The time to criticize will come later.

  - Stories capture our imaginations, create our myths, and mold our
    beliefs and values. Stories give our lives meaning; they integrate
    our brains. Story creates purpose. Storytelling is a necessary part
    of thinking and the development of the human brain. Story creates
    order out of chaos. It establishes patterns that serve as templates
    for life. Story structures knowledge, making it memorable and whole.
    Story takes specific ideas, events, and elements and weaves them
    into a cohesive, holistic narrative. With stories told (not seen),
    children will be able to draw their own pictures out of it.

  - You need your rest—and so does your brain. No one knows why.
    Bertrand Russell, the great mathematician and philosopher, made a
    personal discovery worth noting that if a problem required conscious
    racking of mind for 10 hours to solve the problem, the same problem
    can be solved just by initially racking mind on problem for 1 hour,
    then stop thinking about it. After 9 hours when we return back to
    problem, the subconscious mind would have solved the problem for
    you. The important thing is that, ﬁrst, it must be a problem that
    really matters to you. You must have the desire. Next, you should
    learn as much about the problem as you can. You should be intimately
    familiar with the issues even though you don’t know the answer. It
    helps to have a number of very specific questions about the problem.
    Confusion is often a necessary part of learning and problem solving.
    If you are never confused, you probably aren’t working on problems
    that are difficult enough for you. Finally, the last thing you need
    is time—especially time to sleep on it. That is why it is important
    to start on hard problems early, so you have sufficient time for
    your subconscious mind to work on it. For example, if you have a
    hard problem to solve, force yourself to carefully read problem
    statement, understand the problem, start thinking on its answer. If
    answer is not visible in 1 hour, sleep over it. The problem would be
    solved for you by your subconscious mind.

  - When John F. Kennedy made this statement about moon expedition in
    May 1961, the United States had very little to go on. We had no
    micro electronics, no portable computers, no deep-space
    communications network, no giant rockets, no lunar navigation
    system, and practically no manned space ﬂight experience. America
    had yet to put a man in orbit around Earth, let alone go to the
    moon. John Kennedy dreamed a great dream and ﬁ red the imaginations
    of not only Americans but also people around the world.

  - It is only when you have desire to do something, you will end up
    doing it. Otherwise, it is as good as not done or worse if done with
    little care. This heavy desire can come only from high imagination.

**1. DREAM -**

``` code
  a. Imagine It - "One who has never failed, has never attempted!".
  b. Work on the Big Picture - "A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step”.

  d. BS! (Back to School or Bull Shit) - BS knows no decorum, no bound, no fear, and no respect. 
  e. Brainstorm - “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” - Sherlock Holmes.
  f. Create Desire - It is only when you have desire to do something, you will end up doing it.
  g. Tell a Story - "Biggest part of creativity lies within being able to think independently and draw pictures out of it."
  h. Sleep on It - It is important to start on hard problems early, so you have sufficient time for your subconscious mind to work on it.
  i. Think JFK - He gave us the big picture and aimed higher than anyone dared believe. Maybe he even BS’d a little.
