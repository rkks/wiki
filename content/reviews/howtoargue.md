“The aim of argument, or of discussion, should not be victory but
progress.” Karl Popper

Arguing should lead to a better understanding of another person’s point
of view and a better understanding of your own.

**Golden Rule \#1: Be prepared**  
Make sure you know the essential points you want to make. Research the
facts you need to convince your opponent. Being prepared for an argument
is key to success. Sometimes arguments come out of the blue. But not
always.

**Golden Rule \#2: When to argue, when to walk away**  
Think carefully before you start to argue: is this the time; is this the
place?

**Golden Rule \#3: What you say and how you say it**  
Spend time thinking about how to present your argument. Body language,
choice of words and manner of speaking all affect how your argument will
come across.

**Golden Rule \#4: Listen and listen again**  
Listen carefully to what the other person is saying. Watch their body
language, listen for the meaning behind their words.Golden Rule \#5:
Excel at responding to arguments

**Golden Rule \#5: Excel at responding to arguments**  
Think carefully about what arguments the other person will listen to.
What are their preconceptions? Which kinds of arguments do they find
convincing?

**Golden Rule \#6: Watch out for crafty tricks**  
Arguments are not always as good as they first appear. Be wary of your
opponent’s use of statistics. Keep alert for distraction techniques such
as personal attacks and red herrings. Look out for concealed questions
and false choices.

**Golden Rule \#7: Develop the skills for arguing in public**  
Keep it simple and clear. Be brief and don’t rush.

**Golden Rule \#8: Be able to argue in writing**  
Always choose clarity over pomposity. Be short, sharp and to the point,
using language that is easily understood.

**Golden Rule \#9: Be great at resolving deadlock**  
Be creative in finding ways out of an argument that’s going nowhere. Is
it time to look at the issue from another angle? Are there ways of
putting pressure on so that the other person has to agree with you? Is a
compromise possible?

**Golden Rule \#10: Maintain relationships**  
This is absolutely key. What do you want from this argument?
Humiliating, embarrassing or aggravating your opponent might make you
feel good at the time, but you might have many lonely days to rue your
mistake. Find a result that works for both of you. You need to move
forward. Then you will be able to argue again another time\!
