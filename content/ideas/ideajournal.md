## Future:

  - Schools (competition, contents, and networking) - Today schools face
    high competition, lack good teachers, and are cut-off from industry.
    Provide differentiation, provide quality stuff, and help bridge the
    gap between industry and teaching. Many people do this, what is your
    value-add?

  - Digital asset manager/Declutterer - A software that organizes all
    personal data into respective folders, helps cleanup personal space,
    and provides reminders.

  - Mobile as a hidden audio-video recorder, surveillance camera - Easy
    to do, many are there, still there is room for more. But technology
    is still far behind. Camera on mobile doesn't give good picture
    quality, poor network bandwidth, MMS is expensive for its worth,
    storage capacity is also minimal.

  - Mobile as a local phone (SIP) when WiFi is available - Additional
    gadgets to convert a laptop into phone are available. Also
    telephones to call through internet are also available in US. Not
    sure of India.

  - Auto-sync and backup of mobile contents in background (each time the
    laptop is open and mobile is on) - Available as an option in Nokia
    OVI Suite and other mobile suites. Still has potential.

## Present:

  - Bride Groom DB - Bride and Groom database from Sankethi community.
    Used to capture all information in Sankethi Sampada online. So that
    it can be looked up any time. Static page present. Need to make it
    dynamic.

  - Blog - Blog started as a medium to put across my ideas, a way of
    expression. Though I like and practice writing with excellence, but
    not interested in writing as a profession. I am not a assembler, I
    am a producer. I read, I think, I express. While I love to talk,
    think and understand, at same time I am not satisfied only by
    dialogue. I feel more pleasure in getting it to a reality.

  - RSS aggregator - Already many of them exist, both FOSS and
    commercial. Though, most of them fall short on quality, not my area
    of expertise. Already installed 'tiny tiny rss aggregator' at my web
    hosting to eliminate dependency on google reader.

## Past:

  - Psuedo Filesystem - Started as a small project to help myself deepen
    the understanding and also to train Manoj. A file system that can
    help to debug any other file system operations by journalling
    actions.

  - Psuedo Network Driver - Started as a small project to help myself
    deepen the understanding and also to train Rajshekhar Biradar. A
    network driver that dumps packets based on packet types and certain
    criteria. Mostly to be used for debugging network applications.

  - Mobile data sync - A pet project to sync data between Web server and
    a mobile using XML format and use of serialization. Work in J2ME.
    Didn't go much far.

  - Gumstix bluetooth to serial converter - A pet project to interface
    mobile device with a serial console like LED board to display
    whatever text provided by mobile on LED board.

  - Local search of (scholors, engineers, subject matter experts) - Many
    exist today including Linkedin, Societies, Facebook. Though you may
    not easily find what you are looking for, but you can certainly
    search for them. Difficult to bring-in people without much
    advertisement and active community.

  - Mobile content aggregator - Mobiles were not very capable of doing
    heavy duty tasks. Even today, you can't expect to carry around all
    your digital arsenal in your cute little phone. There ain't much
    space, processing power or network capabilities.

  - GPS/location watermarking of photos in mobile - Already implemented
    in today's mobiles.

  - Mobile as a remote control - Already many such applications are
    available.

  - Push software to any mobile over bluetooth, and start sending
    data/songs/images from that mobile to our mobile - Available as a
    Standard called OTN.

## Illegal:

  - Ebook finder, reviews aggregator & auto-downloader - Automatically
    builds a list of books by RSS feeds, Looks up book review ratings
    online from GoodReads, Downloads book from download sites like
    Rapidshare/MegaUpload on user selection. Abondoned as illegal.

  - Auto-video recorder - man vs wild. Already many of the TV Tuner
    software allow for automated recordings. On other hand standard DVR
    recorders are available for recording and watching TV contents
    later. But saving recording into laptop/HDD can be a violation of
    copyright laws. Illegal.

  - Backup of copyrighted music from phone - Illegal.

  - Invisible keylogger and network password sniffer over ssh, telnet,
    http, etc. - Illegal.

  - List all docs/files in home directory of all users, on laptops of
    all users on network
