My reviews mainly include the book summaries, notes, learning, that it imparted.
There are many which are completely useless, there is a post to capture that too.
So that you don't waste your time reading it.

Captured following details in most of the reviews:

1.  Rating - I follow 3 point (that I call, IJK) rating system.
    
      - Book impressed me (I). You may want to read further.
    
      - Book had few good points (J). Just good enough for you to skim
        through.
    
      - Book will kill you (K). You wouldn't wanna spend any time
        surfing through this book.

2.  Book Summary - Depends on rating for the book.
    
      - In (K), you seldom find any notes. I couldn't find any new,
        magnificent, non-obvious stuff.
    
      - In (J), you will find few bullet points capturing key takeaways
        and highlights.
    
      - (I) would have detailed summary, sometimes categorized by
        chapters/topics, illustrations, key takeaways. Don't be
        surprised if you find paragraphs quoted “as it is” to maintain
        brevity of content.
