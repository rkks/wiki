## Introduction to Research:

Two most common types of research are:
1. Correlational Research and 
2. Experimental Research.

1. Correlational Research: In this research, the goal is to determine whether
two or more variables are related. (A 'variable' is anything that can take on
different values, such as weight, time, height etc). If correlation between two
variables is strong enough, knowing about one variable allows researcher to
predict about another variable. There are several types of correlation.

PS: A correlation between two things doesn't necessarily mean that one thing
caused the other. For ex, A correlation is - as age grows, the weight grows.
This doesn't mean that age has grown the weight. Weight primarily increases by
food. The correlation just points out the phenomenon that humans have tendency
to grow their weight with their age.

2. Experimental Research: To draw a cause-and-effect conclusion, a researcher
must use the experimental research. Experimental research involves comparing
two groups on one outcome measure to test some hypothesis regarding causation.
For ex, if one has to test effect of protocol accelerator on Application, he
can divide the number of test setups into 2 groups. On one group (called
'experimental' group), researcher will put the accelerator and then run the
application. One the another group (called 'control' group), he will not put
any accelerator and run the application. After doing multiple
iterations/samples of tests, both the test results will be compared against
each other to see whether the application on 'experimental' group has been
benefited by accelerator in any way (performance, throughput etc). If there has
been a performance/throughput gain in the 'experimental' group, the accelerator
is said to increase the throughput of applications.

Science can be defined as a methodical and systematic approach to the gain of
new knowledge. Scientific knowledge is not based on opinions or feelings,
rather it is based on the accumulation of empirical evidence.

Research method is a set of research methods and principles that helps
researchers obtain valid results from their research studies. It provides set
of clear and agreed-upon guidelines for gathering, evaluating and reporting
information in context of research study. Scientific method is characterized by
following elements:

1. Empirical Approach - Empirical approach is an evidence-based approach that
relies on direct observation and experimentation in acquisition of the new
knowledge. With its emphasis on direct, systematic and careful observation, it
is best thought of as the guiding principle behind all research conducted in
accordance with scientific method.

2. Observations - Observation refers to two distinct concepts, being aware of
the world around us and making careful & accurate measurements. An important
aspect of observation is 'operational definitions'. Researchers define key
concepts and terms in their research studies by using operational definitions.
Operational definitions help researcher to ensure that everyone is talking
about the same phenomenon.

3. Questions - After getting a research idea, by making observation of world
around us, the next step in research process is translating the research idea
into an 'answerable' question. 'answerable' is important aspect, which refers
to capability of answering through available research methods and procedures.

4. Hypothesis - Hypothesis is simply an educated and testable guess about the
answer to research 'question'. A key feature of all hypothesis is that each
must make a prediction. Hypothesis are the attempt by researcher to explain the
phenomenon being studied, and that explanation should involve the prediction
about the variables being studied. These predictions are then tested by
gathering and analyzing data; and the hypothesis can either be supported or
refuted on basis of data. There are two types of hypothesis:

a) null hypothesis - It always predicts that there will be no difference
between the groups studied. And researcher tries to disprove the hypothesis by
contradiction.
b) experimental (or alternate) hypothesis - It predicts that there will be a
difference between the groups. These two hypothesis are not mutually exclusive.
In given set of hypothesis, some may be null and others can be experimental.
The hypothesis being tested by a researcher is highly dependent on the type of
research design being used.

One more important aspect of hypothesis is that it should be 'falsifiable'. If
hypothesis is not 'falsifiable', then science cannot be used to test the
hypothesis. For ex, religious beliefs are not falsifiable, because we can never
prove a faith based hypothesis are wrong. So, there would be no point in
conducting research to test them.

5. Experiments or Research Study - A key aspect of Research study or experiment
is measuring the phenomenon of interest in an 'accurate' and 'reliable' manner.
'accurate' refers to whether the measurement is correct, and 'reliability'
refers to whether the measurement is consistently repeated.

6. Analyses. - Analyses of data involves the use of statistical techniques.
Type of statistical technique used depends on the design of study, type of data
gathered, and questions being asked. A key decision that researchers must make
with the assistance of statistics is whether the 'null hypothesis' should be
rejected. (IMP) There are only two choices with respect to the null hypothesis:
the 'null hypothesis' can either be rejected or not rejected, but it can never
be accepted. This is because, "'null hypothesis' not rejected" just means that
we were unable to detect any difference between groups in our study, while in
reality there might be significant difference between the two groups. The
decision of whether to reject or not reject a null hypothesis based on
statistical analyses is prone to two types of errors: 

a) Type I error (false positive) - It occurs when a researcher concludes that
there is a difference between groups being studied when, in fact, there is no
difference.
b) Type II error (false negative) - It occurs when a researcher concludes that
there is no difference between groups being studied when, in fact, there is a
difference.

The typical convention in most fields of science allows for a 5% chance of
erroneously rejecting a null hypothesis (type I error). That is, a researcher
will conclude that there is a significant difference between groups being
studied only if the chance of being incorrect is less than 5%. Chance of error
in research cannot be made 0, because there is an inverse relationship between
type I and II errors. That is, by decreasing the probability of making type I
error, the researcher is increasing the probability of making type II error.
So, 5% level is a standard convention in most fields of research represents a
compromise between making type I and type II errors.

7. Conclusions - It is important that researchers make only those conclusions
that can be supported by the data analyses, otherwise its a sin. i.e., if a
correlational study indicates strong correlation between two groups, the
researcher cannot conclude that one thing caused the other. So, it is important
to understand that relationship between two things does not equal causation.
For example, If a correlation study says, most people who own cars also own a
house doesn't mean that car has caused house or house has caused car. Its just
some simple relation that one discovered. This relationship should not be used
to make predictions or statements by self.

8. Replication - Replication essentially means conducting the same research
study a second time with another group of participants to see whether the same
results are obtained. It helps mainly to decide whether the results of the
original study are 'generalizable' to other groups. So, replication serves
several integral purposes, including establishing the reliability (i.e.
consistency) of research study findings and determining whether the same
results can be obtained with different groups of participants.

Goals of Scientific Research:
----------------------------
Most researchers agree that the three goals of research are:
1. Description - Description refers to the process of defining, classifying, or
categorizing phenomenon of interest. For ex, description of relationship,
describing cause and effect etc. Descriptive research is useful because it can
provide important information regarding the average member of a group being
studied. One example of descriptive research is correlational research. In
correlational research, the researcher attempts to determine whether there is a
relationship/correlation between two or more variables and then tries to
describe the relationship (if exists) based on the collected data.

2. Prediction - Prediction based research often stems from previously conducted
descriptive research. If researcher finds that there is a
relationship/correlation between two variables, then it may be possible to
predict one variable from the knowledge of the other variable. Many important
questions both in science and real world involve predicting one thing based on
knowledge of something else.

3. Understanding/Explanation - Being able to describe something and having
ability to predict one thing based on knowledge of another are important goals
of scientific research, but they do not provide researchers with a true
understanding of a phenomenon. True understanding of a phenomenon is achieved
only when researchers successfully identify the cause or causes of the
phenomenon. The ability of researchers to make valid casual inferences is
determined by the type of research design they use. 'Correlational research'
does not permit researchers to make casual inferences regarding the
relationship between the two things that are correlated. By contrast, a
randomized controlled study permits researchers to make valid cause-and-effect
inferences. There are 3 prerequisites for drawing an inference of causality
between two events:

a) There must be an existing relationship between two events - It means that
the events must 'covary (or co vary)' - i.e. as one changes, the other must
also change. If two events do not covary, then a researcher cannot conclude
that one event caused the other event.

b) The one event (cause) must precede the other event (effect) - Obviously, if
two events occur simultaneously, it cannot be concluded that one event caused
the other. Similarly, if the observed effect comes before the presumed cause,
it would make little sense to conclude that the cause caused the effect.

c) Alternative explanations for the relationship must be ruled out - Stating it
another way, a causal explanation between two events can be accepted only when
other possible causes of observed relationship have been ruled out. This can be
done by allowing only one variable under study to vary between groups under
consideration. If more than one variables change at same time, it will be very
difficult to identify the reason for variable. If in an experiment more than
one variables change/vary at same time, the research is said to be
'confounded'.

There are two broad categories of research:
1. Quantitative vs. Qualitative -
a) A Quantitative research involves studies that make use of statistical
analyses to obtain their findings. Key features include formal and systematic
measurement and use of statistics.
b) A Qualitative research involves studies that do not attempt to quantify
their results through statistical summary or analysis. Qualitative studies
typically involve interviews and observations without formal measurement.
Qualitative research is often used as a source of hypotheses for later testing
with Quantitative research.

2. Nomothetic vs. Idiographic -
a) A nomothetic approach uses the study of groups to identify general laws that
apply to large group of people. The goal is often to identify the average
member of the group being studied or average performance of a group member.
b) A idiographic approach is study of individual. An example of idiographic
approach is case study.

Choice of approach largely depends on type of questions asked in research study
and category of research.

Two key terms in field of research are:
1. Population - The population is all individuals of interest to researcher.
2. Sample - Since study of entire population is not feasible in most of the
cases, researchers typically study a subset of the population, and that subset
is called a Sample. Because researchers may not be able to study the entire
population of interest, it is important that the sample be representative of
the population from which it was selected. Studying a representative sample
permits the researcher to draw valid inferences about the population. Simply
putting, more the sample represents the whole population, more chances are that
the results can be generalized to entire population.

There are two types of Correlation:
1. Positive Correlation - A positive correlation between two variables means
that both variables change in the same direction.
2. Negative Correlation - A negative correlation between two variables means
that as one variable increases, the other variable decreases. In other words,
the variables change in opposite direction.

Important definitions that differentiate "Research Design" from "Research Methodology":
1. Research Methodology refers to the principles, procedures, and practices
that govern research. It should be thought of as encompassing entire process of
conducting research, including planning & conducting research study, drawing
conclusions, and disseminating findings).
2. Research Design refers to the plan used to examine the question of interest.
On contrast to Research Methodology, the Research Design refers to many ways in
which the research can be conducted to answer the question being asked.

Some important statements:
- The first step in conducting research involves coming up with an idea and
translating this idea into a testable question or statement.

## Critical Notes on Research

1. It is always desirable to limit one's topic "as soon as possible" to
eliminate wasteful and unproductive reading; but one has to keep title
provisional "as long as possible". Because one doesn't simply know what he is
going to discover; and discoveries may lead to complete change of direction and
title.

2. While choosing a research topic (rather than going with fascinating topics),
one has to ask few brutally realistic questions like: Have the books/papers
actually been written on the subject? Am I reachable to that content? Because
the value and quality of research entirely depends on sources of information at
hand.

3. First objective of a researcher is the preparation of as full a
bibiliography as practicable.

4. The distinction must be made between primary and secondary sources. Primary
materials are not based on other written works. They are in their original
form, without having been arranged or interpreted by anyone else. For ex.
official docs, standards docs. Secondary source (by far larger groups) discuss
primary sources. They consist of works which select, edit and interpret this
primary source material. Even most experienced scolars sometimes fall into the
pitfall of considering what X said about Z as - to the conclusion of what Z
actually said. So, one must maintain contact with original material they are
discussing. Apart from the need to draw some conclusions of one's own, it is
here in primary sources that little nuggets of information may be found that
have been over looked by other researchers, for one reason or the other. It is
such nuggets which may give distinction to one's own work. One should be able
to classify the sources of information (books, papers) with him as primary and
secondary.

5. All the sources, published and unpublished, must be recorded with accuracy.
This can then be filtered down to useful bibiliography. It should also contain,
how to abtain same resource if required in future. All references should be
maintained. It would also be good to associate some rating to a source based on
a quick impression of work.

6. Bibiliography arranging style:
For Books:
Author(s) [Last Name, First Name], Title (Italicized).

For single author, name should be written last name first, followed by comma,
followed by first name or initials. Where there is more than one author, the
first author should be listed last name first [Last Name First Name], followed
by comma, and subsequent author(s) in normal order, seperated by commas. If
there are more than 3 authors, it is the practice to put 'et. al' (Italicized)
or "and others" after the name of first author.

If work of author is translated or edited by someone, this additional
information should be given after the author's name and title of work. for ex: 

Castigilione, Baldesar, The Book of Courtier (Italicized), trans. Charles S. Singleton, ed. Edgar de N.Mayhew.

If work has no author, but an editor or compiler, then list work by its title
followed by comma and the name of the editor. For ex:
The Nazi Years: a Documentary History, edited by Johim Remak.

If the work is produced by public body, list it by its title and include the
other information with the publishing details. For ex. 
Case Studies in Multiculture education: a series of documentary films (British Broadcasting Corporation, London, 1981).

Then comes, number of edition used. ed. 3rd ed. Wherever relevant, related
information like, volume number (if in multiple volumes), and 'revised or
enlarged' etc should be given. Follows the place of publication, date of
publication.

For Articles, reviews:
- All details for articles follow same as book except for title. The title of
article is enclosed in single quotation marks, and followed by comma, unless
the title ends with a question or exclamation mark.
- If article appears in a book, the title will be followed by 'in' and the name
of book (italicized), followed by publication details as mentioned for books,
page number. For ex:
Kershaw, Ian, 'How effective was Nazi Propaganda?' in Nazi Propaganda (Italicized), edited by David Welch (London, 1983), pp. 180-221.

- If article is from journal the date will also include month of publication. 
- If article is from newspaper the date will also include date month and year of publication.
- If an article is accessed online, title should be followed by word
'[online]'. And a new sentence "Available from:" and website URL, accessed date
in square brackets should be mentioned.

7. After preparing a raw/initial bibiliography, one should reduce it to small
and working bibiliography. To do this, one would need to weigh each source of
information on two scales: a) data of publication and b) standing of author.
In science & technology, more recent the publication is, more accurate it would
be. While in History, more older it is, likely more accurate it would be.  

8. Single note should taken per note card/note pad; a note consisting of one
idea!. This method is benefited as these notes/ideas can be either rearranged
or rejected easily at the later stage of compilation. Waste is inseperable from
Research, but ability to reject unwanted notes and ability to rearrange them
facilitates research. A note contains 3:
- a descriptive label, main body of note itself and the reference to source.
A note should contain only an idea and nothing else. But techniques of
recording an idea should be rigorously applied. Refernce to source can be very
short (just to identify the source in bibiliography prepared). It can contain
[Lastname of Author, Book title (in short), Page Number].

Whole research is founded on full and accurate information which can be
verified later, if needed.

9. A note can be of 3 types: A direct quotation; a paraphrase or summary of
original passage; and writer's own opinions. These must be rigidly
distinguished. 

Statements in which every word counts, should be noted as exactly (as a
directed quotation). Often very large quantity of data can be summarized in few
generalizations. One paraphrases a passage for the importance of its 'content'
(note: main goal of paraphrasing is to give importance to 'content'), one
quotes it directly for the additional importance of its 'mode of expression'.
In either case, an original quotation should be followed in all respects. If
text uses American or outmoded spelling, it should be copied scurplously. An
error or fatuity in text should be copied, and followed with [sic] (italicized)
which means 'thus in the original'. If anything has been omitted from passage
copied, it should be indicated with ellipsis marks (...). If a considerable
amount is omitted, this should be indicated by adding a single line of spaced
full stops. If words have to be inserted to make sense of a passage, they
should be enclosed in square [] brackets to distinguish them from parantesis ()
that may appear occasionally in quoted text. Square brackets are always an
indication of an editorial intervention of some kind. The complete quotation,
with or without expressions or additions, should be enclosed in single
quotation marks and any quotations within it should be enclosed in double
quotation marks.

A paraphrase is written without quotation marks. If quotation marks are
present, that is proof that quotation is exact copy of the original; if
quotation marks are not present, that is proof that the words are the
researcher's own. A good plan is to read passage carefully, think about it for
a moment, keep the text aside and write the note without looking at actual
text, then check it again to make sure that original author has not been
misrepresented.

Personal comments are extremely valuable record of stray ideas that flash
across mind in the process of note-taking. All personal comments should be
preceded by one's initials in parentesis ().

A sophisticated note may contain original quote, paraphrase and own's comment
on same in sigle note. It can also be accompanied by cross-reference to other
notes.

Efficincy of note-taking relies on two: atomization of knowledge and
reliability of source of information.

10. Even in summary one must be careful to note the exact source of
information, since due acknowledgement has to be made, in paper, of ideas,
theories and obscure facts.

11. Writing Outline of Research Paper is toughest of all. One should set aside
two three hours of thought to draw an outline. Because, once outline is drawn,
it is hard to break and harder to alter. One should be prepared ruthlessly to
abondon large tracts of notes in order to prevent paper from being superflous
and inacceptable. Not everything explored can be presented. The decision to
accept and discard should be made in light of purpose of project. This is also
the appropriate time to ask questions like, Can I complete project on these
lines within given period ? Should I narrow down the scope of work?

Normally, it is good to minimize the briefing about prior art and history, so
that one can concentrate on work done by oneself and present its attributes in
good detail. Probably this is also a good time to give a good thought on title
for the paper. As if Title is decided, the matter flows from Title to Outline
and from there to selection of Material.

12. A brief introduction states the main purpose and direction of paper.

Unpublished sources can bring in lot of information and valuable mark to research.

For guidelines on writing style, presentation pattern etc, some commonly
accepted are:

- Modern Humanities Research Association Style Book (3rd ed, 1981).

In judgement of good source, the critics could be quite useful. But, critics
could be biased, incompetent, unfair. One such journal that provides reviews:

## Research Tips

- Don't be self centric. Promoting the success of others is also one way to
promote your success.
- Donot under estimate or over estimate your work. Be realistic when choosing
journal or showing your work.
- Be ready to take and give criticism.
- Understand the limitations of your country and your surroundings. Don't
complain about them, but try to solve them if possible.
- Try to find people in your own area who are having ideas and thoughts similar
to that of you.
- Be member of a research team before trying to leading one.
- You may be the only genius in your place/country. But there are several
intellectuals more intelligent than you in globe. Have this perception in your
mind.
- Concentrate on your work and keep away from distractions like meetings, other
duties etc.
- It is not at all necessary that you choose the research topics choosen by
strong international research teams. You cannot compete with them. And research
is not a race, but a motive to solve problems. So, choose local problems and
try solving it. This way you would also help your own people and nation.
- Try to explore collaboration locally and abroad.
- Be generous with everybody.
- Attend national and international seminars and workshops. If you lack money
to attend them, apply for grants.
- Donot get frustrated when some grant or paper publishing request is rejected.
- Avoid publishing your works in magzines or low quality journals, submit your
papers to international journals.
- Avoid complaining infront of others. It lowers your prestige.
- Cultivate ability to find alternative solutions and persuade people.
- Give talks and write about science whenever you consider it pertinent. But
donot over-budget them.

## How to write a research paper:-
1. Take backup of your work :).
2. Printed material is acceptible, not the handwritten one.
3. 3 keywords in research philosophy: organization, discipline, and convention.
4. An essay writing is related to creativity, imagination and self expression; but they are irrelevant in research. Never mistake research paper as an essay writing.
5. Always try to justify and give reasons to all your assertions.
6. Conventions are vital in a context where one writes not for oneself, but for critical public.
