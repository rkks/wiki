  - Even best programmers make mistakes.

  - The most important single aspect of software development is to be
    clear about what you are trying to build. First understand and then
    be understood.

  - If you make a fool-proof program, the world will create a bigger
    fool.

  - Attention to details is essential for better code.

  - Focus is secret sauce of successful problem solving.

  - The line never tested is the line with the potential bug.

  - There is no shortcut to success.

  - Incorrect documentation is often worse than no documentation.

  - Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring
    aircraft building progress by weight.

  - Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

  - Just shut up and hack.

Good Programming Practice:

  - Keep code as concise as you can.

  - Always compare constants (i.e. \#defines) against variables. This
    avoids null pointer dereferences. ex: if (ABC == var) instead of if
    (var == ABC)
