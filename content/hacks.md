I love to automate the boring, mundane stuff with scripts & tools. In that
spirit, few hacks, tips-n-tricks discovered over all these years of work.

Notes are mostly reference to myself and to anyone who may be interested.

My scripts can be found here: [My scripts](https://github.com/rkks/scripts)
