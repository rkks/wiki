My notes on software development best practices, learning from mistakes, observations,
improvements, and so on. I love to automate the boring, mundane stuff with scripts,
tools, and day-to-day common things we're used to. In that spirit, few hacks,
tips-n-tricks discovered over all these years of work. Noting as reference to myself
and to anyone who may be interested. My scripts can be found here
