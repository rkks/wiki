% January 1, 2006

## First things first:

1.  Expertise is a relative term - Remember excellence, not perfection.

2.  Learn from books, people and experience.
    
      - Write, Think, and Talk about the subject with people.
    
      - Write an article and send for publication in one of the industry
        magazines.
    
      - Look at current topics, advertisements, discussions, etc. to be
        on top of current affairs in industry.
    
      - Offer to speak at a local college.

3.  Focus: Instead of just focusing on the very next step you need to
    take, it's easy to be overwhelmed by the bigger picture.
    
      - Narrow your field of expertise. You can still understand
        neighbouring things, but they aren't your expertise.
    
      - Immerse yourself into it. Dedication/Determination/Devotion.
    
      - Repeatedly apply your expertise and knowledge that you gained in
        similar situations. Practise makes man Perfect.
    
      - Develop your insightful approach to problem. Your paradigm.

4.  Get outside help: Find mentors, friends, experts, coaches who can
    help you. At some point, learning and practicing will only get you
    so far. You need feedback from outsiders to uncover more
    opportunities for improvement.
    
      - Be professinal and courteous in accepting criticisms and
        appreciations.
    
      - Watch other experts perform. There is no alternative to
        apprenticeship.
    
      - Same time, make it a point to help others in need.

5.  Make mistakes. You have to be willing to make mistakes in order
    to learn and grow. The sooner you get comfortable with making
    mistakes, the quicker you'll learn your new skill.
    
      - Start very small.
    
      - Do only one thing at a time.
    
      - Be present and enjoy the activity (don't focus on results).
    
      - Be grateful for every step you take.

Thank people:

1.  Thank for failure - Thank them for providing you a chance. Failure
    isn't end of world. It is only end of current work at hand.

2.  Thank for criticism - Thank them for providing their insight. People
    criticize only when they care.

3.  Thank for respect - Be thankful to people who respect you and who
    have brought you to given position.

Spread the word:

1.  The audience won't come to you. You need to find them, so they will
    come.

2.  Understand no one cares what you need. Everybody cares what they
    need. If you focus on their needs, you can fulfill yours too.

3.  Discard 80 percent of your message, only 20% matters. Pitch it with
    your own style.

\<note important\>More important ones below:\</note\>

1.  You must start with show, not tell. Everyone has ideas. Ideas are
    cheap. Talk is even cheaper. We listen to leading thinkers because
    their ideas have been validated by success. A visionary without a
    platform is a tree that falls in the forest and makes no sound. When
    you prove your vision is valid, gaining recognition for visionary
    thinking is much easier.

2.  If everyone agrees, you're preaching to the choir. Most of us follow
    basic business principles. But how we apply those principles may be
    (slightly) different. To be a groundbreaker you must take a very
    different approach, and that means many people will disagree with
    your thinking even after you've proven you're right. See push back
    as a sign you may really be on to something.

3.  For a while no one will listen. Groundbreakers not only need great
    ideas, they also need to effectively communicate those ideas.

4.  You must be sure the effort is worth it. You'll invest countless
    hours writing, speaking, promoting, and networking, possibly for
    very little return. Take a hard look at the tangible benefits you
    expect to receive.
