# Stop waste, save planet - Cisco - 16Feb2015

* We produce too much waste - 3.5 Million tonnes/day in 2010, 6 Million tonnes/day by 2025
* Global cost of dealing with trash - $205 billion/yr in 2010, #375 billion/yr by 2025
* Commercial waste overhead (unsold inventory trashed) amounts to 40% of total production

Problem (Traditional business)
-----------------------------
* Purchase materials at bulk, expect to sell them at a margin, trash unsold stuff
* Some products can't be recycled - such as medicines, silicon chips, plastic
* Most shops are not interconnected - don't know if product is on shelf of next store
* Inventory mismanagement, inefficient old ways of collecting supply-demand ratio (visit store)
* Even stores like Woodland don't know if some inventory is present in their store elsewhere

Solution (Connect Data)
------------
* A platform that allows vendors to share their inventory log with other vendors
* Zero overhead of maintenance, fully secure, 24/7 available, highly useful
* Free software with each Cisco access points, tightly integrated, reliable
* Interoperable with wide variety of databases: foxpro, sql, access-db, no-sql
* Interoperable with wide variety of interfaces: barcode scanner, zippy scanner

Advantage
---------
* Be at center of what matters. Accurate analytics, true supply-demand information

Best Bet
--------
* Medical store chains - Many have computerized inventory management
* Can save lives by providing accurate snapshot of available medicines nearby
* Governments would support initiatives that are for low waste, green community

What If?
--------
* What if somebody doesn't want to share their inventory? Or only to a few?
* Free! How do you make money?
* What about large retail chains who have inventory management built-in?

Future
------
* Extend to household, barcode reader on refrigerator/shelfs, may be?
