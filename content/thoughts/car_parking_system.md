# Vehicle Parking System

A simple way of implementing Vehicle Parking Management system works as:

- A weight sensor is placed under humps on both entry and exits of parking area
- Total capacity of parking area is pre-configured into the management system
- Whenever a vehicle passes over entry hump, num of available slots is decremented
- Whenever a vehicle passes over exit hump, num of available slots is incremented

Pros: Simple to implement and cost-effective
Cons: Not efficient. Can't help driver find a vacant slot. Error prone
