# Get a Mentor without Asking

* Find out people: whose work you admire, who have travelled the road you choose
* Start following their work, be helpful, comment positively, give what they like
* Be enjoyable, cheerful, respectful, show certain value they can look forward to
* Be great at what you do, ask for more, promote success of others, build network

Remember, there is no leader without a follower
