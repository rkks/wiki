# Online RSS aggregator - Simple and Elegant
------------------------------------------
Since google reader is taken out by Google as a product; below is the idea to pilot a small project.

Functional reqs:
* Receive online RSS feeds in ATOM and RSS feed formats.
* Expose clean and readable interface for rss feeds without clutter.
* Ensure ease of navigation using vim like key-bindings.
* Allow for two modes of display surf and read.
	- surf mode will display one-line headers that could be easily skimmed through.
	- read mode will display complete content as much possible in the feed itself.
* Allow for import and export of feeds from popular formats (OPML and XML).
* Rank user feeds and rearrange mostly read ones based on usage statistics of given feed by user.
* Add/Removal of unlimited number of users (in terms of technology) should be supported.
* Importing of feeds, tags, and populating contents should be instantaneous.
* Navigation of website should be drag free, smooth and elegant experience.
* Support few selected, but most commonly used browsers for rendering.
* Application by itself should store nothing more than required to populate feeds
	- no external credentials, no settings, no strings, no ads.
* Desirably do the global ranking of incoming URLs, feeds and sources based on usage.
* Desirably suggest new feeds based on the interests of feed subscribers.
* Allow for easy import of settings from different feed readers like google, feedly, etc.
* Allow for easy sharing of posts using facebook, blogs, twitter, and mails.

Non-functional reqs:
* Should be easy to develop, maintain, upgrade, and debug.
* Should be able to easily scale for large number of users and data.
* Shoube be able to monitor different aspects of application easily.

Reqs gathered from blogs:
* Should be Web based
* Should allow OPML import and/or Google Reader synchronization
* Shoulw support Rich content
* Desirably works on Mobile
* Free - A much wanted option

Timeline
--------
Google will shutdown the reader by Jul 1, 2013. So, essentially the alpha version should be up and running before that.
3 months and 10 days left to effective launch of the service. That means, 3 months to implement it completely.

Feasibilty Check
----------------
* Technical
	- Is it possible to implement the solution in given time?
	- How easy/difficult is it for you to understand the technology to develop this?
	- Do you completely understand all the requirements of such an application?
	- Can you list the set of challenges in developing such an app?
	- Is there anybody who could help you when you are totally stuck with something?
	- Do you have estimates of computational requirement, memory, bandwidth requirement?
* Money
	- How much money is required to support 100000 users initially?
	- What are the other operational expenses required to keep site running 24/7?
* Personal
	- Are you ready to invest your personal time and effort towards this?
	- How prepared is your family for this challenge? Who are with you on this?
	- How long are you ready to wait for it to succeed?
	- How well you can manage this stuff given other responsibilities of day job and family?
* Business
	- why you want to do this in first place? what do you expect out of it? Sleep over it and then decide.
	- Do you expect to make money from this? If yes, How much? and How will you make it?
	- Are there any legal problems in doing this while being in a day job.
	- How do you tell people what you have built? What is different they get by using your service?
	- Is this application time critical? If it takes longer, will application have no relevance?
	- How much of attention does it require to operate, maintain, and upgrade?
