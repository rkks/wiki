## Elements of great Conversation

  - **Here's what I'm thinking** - You express yourself without
    appearing oversmart. Back up your statements and decisions. Give
    reasons. Justify with logic, not with position or authority.
    Authority can make you right, but collaboration makes everyone
    rightand makes everyone pull together.

  - **I was wrong** - When you're wrong, say you're wrong. You won't
    lose respect you'll gain it.

  - **That was awesome** - Praise is a gift that costs the giver
    nothing but is priceless to the recipient. Not only identify good
    things in present, but also in past. Identifying things in past
    gives other person a feel of being important and remembered.

  - **You're welcome** - Don't spoil the moment when you are thanked
    or complimented or praised. Make eye contact and say, Thank you.
    Don't let thanks, congratulations, or praise be all about you. Make
    it about the other person, too.

  - **Can you help me?** - When you need help, regardless of the type
    of help you need or the person you need it from, just say, sincerely
    , politely, and humbly, Can you help me?. It speaks powerfully to
    our instinctive desire to help other people. Most importantly -
    DON'T say what you exactly need, too specific. Instead, say what you
    can't do - I am awefully terrible with this thing, I am lost. When
    you ask, several powerful things immediately occur
    
    1.  One, you instantly convey respect. Without actually saying it,
        you've said You know more than I do, You can do what I can't
    
    2.  Two, you instantly convey trust. You show vulnerability, admit
        to weakness, and implicitly show your trust in other person's
        knowledge. You've said, I trust you
    
    3.  Three, you instantly convey you're willing to listen. You
        haven't tried to say exactly how people should help you. You
        give them the freedom to decide. You've said, You don't have to
        tell me what you think I want to hear; tell me what you think I
        should do.

\<note\>That level of respect, level of trust, level of freedom is
incredibly powerful and empowering. By showing you respect and trust
other people, and by giving them the latitude to freely share their
expertise or knowledge, you don't just get the help you think you want.
You might also get the help you really need. You get more, a lot more.
You make it easier for them to ask you for help when they need it.
You've shown it's okay to express vulnerability, to admit a weakness,
and to know when you need help. Best of all, you get to say two more
incredibly powerful words: Thank you.\</note\>

  - **I'm sorry** - When you need to apologize: say you're sorry, say
    why you're sorry, and take all the blame. No less. No more. But
    NEVER follow an apology with a disclaimer that justifies your act or
    transfers the part of blame to other person, even if that's the
    fact.

  - **Can you show me?** - Advice is temporary; knowledge is forever.
    Knowing what to do helps, but knowing how or why to do it means
    everything. Don't just ask for input. Ask to be taught or trained or
    shown.

  - **Let me give you a hand** - Many people see asking for help as a
    sign of weakness. So, many people hesitate to ask for help. But
    everyone needs help. Don't just say, Is there anything I can help
    you with?, Be specific. Find something you can help with. Say I've
    got a few minutes. Can I help you finish that? Offer in a way that
    feels collaborative, not patronizing or gratuitous.

  - ***NOTHING*** - Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing. If
    you're upset, frustrated, or angry, stay quiet. You may think
    venting will make you feel better, but it never does. Results come
    and go, but feelings are forever. You can easily recover from a
    mistake made because of faulty data or inaccurate projections.
    You'll never recover from the damage you inflict on an employee's
    self-esteem. Be quiet until you know exactly what to say and exactly
    what affect your words will have.
