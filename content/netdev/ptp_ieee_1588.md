Used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network. Clock accuracy of
sub-microsecond on LANs. Designed for achieving accuracies on local network
beyond those attainable by NTP. Useful at places & on machines where having
a GPS based receiver is not practical due to circumstances

IEEE Defines if as:
"Standard for a Precision Clock Synchronization Protocol for Networked
Measurement and Control Systems"
