## About Website

This website is created to save, keep up-to date, and share the *useful* information that I find over web. Since the information is gathered over a period of time, I make no assurance on accuracy, applicability, or usefulness of content. However, some information stand by test of time and could be very useful. It is a simple collection of helpful information which falls into either of 3 categories.

1.  *No-Copy:* Links to interesting articles, books, blogs, news, any other web content.

2.  *Part-Copy:* Excerpts of useful text, images, code, commands, or summary of content by me.

3.  *Full-Copy:* Complete article replicated here as its a state-of-art work that can't be duplicated.
